    <p>My interest in Wittgenstein was developed further through television. There were a few programmes about his life and work which were aimed at a broad audience and I found them very absorbing. The following is a collection of those programmes that can now be found on the web.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.christophersykesproductions.com/">Christopher Sykes’</a> BBC Horizon documentary Wittgenstein is brought to life through anecdotes from people that knew him, his letters to friends and commentaries on his work:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/8BoKjQfMihs" frameborder="0">
</iframe>

<p>A series of programmes that I always looked forward to was the BBC’s
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Philosophers">The Great Philosophers</a> with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Magee">Brian Magee</a>. The series covered the philosophies of Plato, Aristotle, and Descartes, among others, and ended with a discussion with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Searle">John Searle</a> on the philosophy of Wittgenstein. In their discussion they cover Wittgenstein’s legacy; ranging from his early work, the Tractatus, to his posthumously published, Philosophical Investigations. Although the thought of two philosophers in deep discussion about Wittgenstein may feel daunting Brian Magee keeps the discussion at a level that is very accessible to the the non-academic:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/EQHiGrCNwJI" frameborder="0"></iframe>

<p>The quality of the writing in the Tractatus and the Philosophical Investigations were mentioned in the discussion and the following sections show the difference in approach and style between the two works. First a section from the Tractatus that discusses language and the nature of philosophy:</p>

<div class="quotewrapper">
<p><i>

<p>4.001 &nbsp; The totality of propositions is the language.</p>

<p>4.002 &nbsp; Man possesses the capacity of constructing languages, in which
every sense can be expressed, without having an idea how and
what each word means—just as one speaks without knowing how
the single sounds are produced. </p>

<p><span>Colloquial language is a part of the human organism and is
not less complicated than it.
From it it is humanly impossible to gather immediately the
logic of language.</span></p>

<p><span>Language disguises the thought; so that from the external
form of the clothes one cannot infer the form of the thought they
clothe, because the external form of the clothes is constructed
with quite another object than to let the form of the body be
recognized. </span></p>

<p><span>The silent adjustments to understand colloquial language are
enormously complicated. </span></p>

<p>
4.003 &nbsp; Most propositions and questions, that have been written about
philosophical matters, are not false, but senseless. We cannot,
therefore, answer questions of this kind at all, but only
state their senselessness. Most questions and propositions of
the philosophers result from the fact that we do not understand
the logic of our language.
<p><span>    (They are of the same kind as the question whether the Good
is more or less identical than the Beautiful.) </span></p>
<p><span>    And so it is not to be wondered at that the deepest problems
are really no problems. </span></p>
</p>

</i></p>
</div>

<p>The following section is from the Philosophical Investigation and discusses again language and the nature of philosophy:</p>

<div class="quotewrapper">
<p><i>

<p>122 &#46;  &#20; A main source of our failure to understand is that we do not
command a clear view of the use of our words.—Our grammar is lacking in
this sort of perspicuity. A perspicuous representation produces just
that understanding which consists in 'seeing connexions'. Hence the
importance of finding and inventing intermediate cases.
The concept of a perspicuous representation is of fundamental
significance for us. It earmarks the form of account we give, the
way we look at things. (Is this a 'Weltanschauung'?)
</p>

<p>123 &#46;  &#20;A philosophical problem has the form: "I don't know my
way about".</p>

<p>124 &#46;  &#20;Philosophy may in no way interfere with the actual use of
language; it can in the end only describe it.
For it cannot give it any foundation either.
It leaves everything as it is.
It also leaves mathematics as it is, and no mathematical discovery
can advance it. A "leading problem of mathematical logic" is for us
a problem of mathematics like any other.
</p>

<p>125 &#46;  &#20;It is the business of philosophy, not to resolve a contradiction
by means of a mathematical or logico-mathematical discovery, but
to make it possible for us to get a clear view of the state of mathematics
that troubles us: the state of affairs before the contradiction is resolved.
(And this does not mean that one is sidestepping a difficulty.)
The fundamental fact here is that we lay down rules, a technique,
for a game, and that then when we follow the rules, things do not
turn out as we had assumed. That we are therefore as it were entangled
in our own rules.
</p>

<span>
This entanglement in our rules is what we want to understand (i.e.
get a clear view of).
</span>

<span> It throws light on our concept of meaning something. For in those
cases things turn out otherwise than we had meant, foreseen. That is
just what we say when, for example, a contradiction appears: "I didn't
mean it like that."
</span>
<br />
<span>
The civil status of a contradiction, or its status in civil life: there is
the philosophical problem.
</span>

<p>
126 &#46;  &#20;Philosophy simply puts everything before us, and neither
explains nor deduces anything.—Since everything lies open to view
there is nothing to explain. For what is hidden, for example, is of no
interest to us.
</p>

<span>
One might also give the name "philosophy" to what is possible
before all new discoveries and inventions.
</span>


<p>
127 &#46;  &#20;The work of the philosopher consists in assembling reminders
for a particular purpose.
</p>

<p>It would have been fascinating, although daunting, to have attended one of Wittgenstein’s lectures at Cambridge University. His rooms were in Trinity College and they had a large view of the sky and also of Cambridge roofs.  They were were sparsely furnished and extremely clean with a deck chair, or two, and virtually nothing else. His lectures were given without preparation and without notes. He would openly struggle with his own thoughts about a philosophical problem and passionately question his own thinking as well as those of the students. The closest example of what it would have been like experiencing one of his lectures is from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derek_Jarman">Derek Jarmin’s</a> film <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wittgenstein_(film)">Wittgenstein</a>:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/r0cN_bpLrxk" frameborder="0"></iframe>

<p>Although Wittgenstein never committed to any formal religion he had a lifelong interest in religion and claimed: “I am not a religious man but I cannot help seeing every problem from a religious point of view.” In television series <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_of_Faith">Sea of Faith</a> <a href="http://www.doncupitt.com/don-cupitt">Don Cupitt</a> gives a different aspect on Wittgenstein’s life and work.  The clip starts with a short introduction about previous religious thinkers:</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Over the years, a handful of books have pointed my curiosity in new directions. But there is one book that is still opening up new areas to explore.</p>

<p>In the late 70’s, after completing my first degree in Agricultural Engineering, there was a sudden drop in the job market as many manufacturers left the UK. I have always, and still do, enjoy mathematics and decided that I had better job prospects building up my mathematical skills. <a href="https://www.cranfield.ac.uk/">Cranfield University</a> provided a course that took engineers, programmers, and scientists and developed their mathematical skills to Masters level in Applied Mathematics.</p>

<p>The course was full of mathematical terminology that was strange to me and I struggled.  Luckily a normal day was structured with lectures in the morning and then we were free in the afternoon to catch up with the work. Most of my fellow students went back to their rooms in the hall of residence but I stayed in the students room at the end of the maths block along with one other, Mike. Mike was much older than me and after a BSc in mathematics had been writing software for the Civil Service. The course was a way to get a better job to support his increasing family. I was sure that I irritated him with my many questions about mathematical problems but with great patience he always had an answer.</p>

<p>During summer, the maths building would get very warm and to cool down I would go to the library situated in the middle of the campus. It had high ceilings and big windows and was well stocked with mathematics books that I could search through to help with the course work. One day I found a copy of Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whithead’s three large volumes of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principia_Mathematica">Principia Mathematica</a> which was their attempt to establish the foundations of mathematics. It was notorious in world of mathematics for taking over four hundred pages to prove that 1 + 1 = 2. I could read the first few pages but my eyes glazed over when logical symbols filled the pages. On returning to the maths department I asked Mike if he knew of anybody who had ever read the three volumes. He replied that there was at least four people: the authors, Kurt Gödel and Ludwig Wittgenstein. I had heard of Gödel because I attended a seminar held in the department, which was way beyond my comprehension. But not Wittgenstein. Mike went on and described how he came from a very rich family in Vienna, started as an engineer and became interested in mathematics and its foundations.  After studying with Russell he produced not one but two great works in philosophy the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tractatus_Logico-Philosophicus">Tractatus Logico-philosophicus</a>
and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_Investigations">Philosophical Investigations</a>.  The thought of an engineer turning out to be a great philosopher gave me a some hope with my mathematical struggles.</p>

<p>A few days later I was walking past the campus book shop and I dropped in my my regular visit. It contained text books that covered the wide variety of course that the Institute offered. However, I was surprised to come across a copy of the Tractatus. I read a few pages and, although I didn’t understand, it caught my attention with its short sentences that had the appearance of logical statement yet have a poetic feel to them:</p>

<div class="quotewrapper">
<p><i>
<p>1 The world is everything that is the case.</p>
<p>1.1 The world is the totality of facts, not of things.</p>
<p>1.11 The world is determined by the facts, and by these being all the
facts.</p>
</i></p>
</div>

<p>I bought the book.</p>

<p>Over the months of reading the Tractatus it emerged that it was not a text book about philosophy but a solution to all philosophical problems. Wittgenstein’s approach was to recognise that when we misuse language then words can lose their meaning and when meaningless words are used they lead to problems in philosophy. The Tractatus was an attempt to show when words lose their meaning and when this happens in the case of philosophy the problems disappear.</p>

<p>I successfully graduated in Applied Mathematics, and over the years gathered many books and papers, about Wittgenstein and his work, including his second philosophical work the Philosophical Investigations. The Philosophical Investigations criticised large sections of the Tractatus and developed a new approach to identify when words lose their meaning.</p>

<p>Wittgenstein’s work is full of sharp observations about the use of language in a wide range of subjects ranging from mathematics and logic to music, religion and culture. I continue to enjoy exploring these subjects which I probably wouldn’t have explored if it hadn’t been for a chance conversation that lit my curiosity.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Online learning is increasing the access to education and training.  However the quality of the courses is very mixed. I have gathered some of the problems that I have experienced and suggested some solutions.</p>

<p>Over the years I have used online learning to increase my knowledge about a wide range of subjects and  develop new skills. The online courses that I have taken include: creative writing, journalism and film making courses through the <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/">Open University</a>  and <a href="https://www.futurelearn.com/">FutureLearn</a>, developing business skills using digital technology with <a href="https://www.digitalbusinessacademyuk.com/">Digital Business Academy</a>, learning about the underlying algorithms of Artificial Intiligence by entering into <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/">Kaggle</a> competitions, and the impact functional programming on bioinformatics by solving problems on the  <a href="http://rosalind.info/problems/locations/">Rosalind</a> website. I have enjoyed these courses and learned a lot but there are some key changes that could be implemented to improve the quality of future online course:</p>

<p><b>1. Course Description</b></p>

<p>Often the course description is aimed more at marketing the course rather than specifying what the student will achieve. Although this approach can attract student numbers it can fail to meet a students expectations by either being too easy or too difficult.</p>

<p>Another aspect is pitching the entry competence at too low a level for the course to attract numbers of students. For example  “ … it involves no computer programming, although you need some experience with using computers for everyday tasks. High-school maths is more than enough”. But once the course has started the competence levels required suddenly shoot and up moves into highly advanced topics that would be considered difficult at first year university!</p>

<p>What is needed is a clear description of what the learner will achieve by the end of the course. One approach would be to have a simple quiz to help the student decide whether they had the correct competence level for the course.  Another is a system that could be developed which would monitor the progress of the student and if they were struggling then other online course or additional material could be recommended e.g. top up via <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a>.</p>

<p><b>2. Rate of Learning</b></p>

<p>My experience has been that the rate at which new concepts are introduced and reinforced can vary: one minute the ideas are straight forward and clearly described with supporting examples but suddenly jump to new concepts which are difficult to understand.  All this can make the rate at which I learn very difficult as I find myself going back to the beginning of the course to find the content that I misunderstood, or search the web for a better explanation.</p>

<p>Another barrier to the speed of learning is the presentation of the material. Unfortunately some of the material looks like cut-and-paste from a lecture notes, or worse, sections are written by different authors and are not consistent in the use of terminology. Sometimes videos are involved, but they can be difficult to link to the course content because they usually cover areas outside of the course.</p>

<p>Usually the student can monitor their own progress through the course by answering questions at the end of each section but the questions rarely test a deep understanding of the material. Also, the answer can be of the yes/no type but if the learning requires the application of a concept then the workings are not checked only the final answer. A lot can be learned from applying a concept and therefore it would be helpful to analyse and point out where the application was going wrong.</p>

<p>The courses produced by the Open University remain the benchmark for online learning and the book <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Teaching_Through_Self_instruction.html?id=qM9qQgAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y">Teaching Through Self-Instruction: How to Develop Open Learning Materials</a> gives an excellent description of the process of developing a course. Their approach could be adopted for future online courses. Another aspect is improving the style of writing and lessons could be taken from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Look_and_Learn">Look and Learn</a> which was a British weekly educational magazine for children. Its aim was to inspire the imagination of its readers with sharply written articles and with a mix of photographs and diagrams gave it an overall feeling of adventure.</p>

<p>Finally, progress of the student could be be monitored using an approache similar to  <a href="https://www.knewton.com/">Knewton</a> with its technology that adapts to students’ proficiency levels with each interaction. Students don’t have to complete a formal assessment or diagnostic to get the instruction and practice they need — it’s provided just-in-time as students work to complete assignments.
For problems where the application of a concept is important then there is an opportunity to develop AI based technology using similar approaches to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-learning">Q-Learning</a>.</p>

<p><b>3. Student Support</b></p>

<p>An important aspect of online learning is the level of support provided to the student, which in most cases is via forums where questions are asked and fellow students help to answer them. The answers are usually voted on and the best one has the most votes. The forums that I have experienced have moderators but unfortunately their involvement has been minimal and therefore opportunities to help with learning have been missed. For example when a question is asked sometimes the people answering may answer a different question. If the moderator had intervened to tease out the underlying problem that is troubling the student then a better answer would be found. All forum moderators should be trained to get the most out of forum activity. Or technology could be developed to analyse the question and relate it to the course content in a way that provides guidance to an answer.</p>

<p>Another aspect is helping students who are struggling to keep up with the course due to motivation, or othe emotional issues.  A lot of research has been done in this area for example the work carried by <a href="http://www.ormondsimpson.com/">Ormond Simpson</a> contains lots of practical advice.</p>

<p>Online learning has increased the access to education around the world which has had an impact on many peoples lives. However, the next challenge for online learning is to improve the quality of the course content so that the participants will approach the same levels as universities and therefore have a credible level of knowledge. This will require more investment in developing the courses as well as identifying new opportunities for ground breaking technology.</p>

    <p>The <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qfvv">Shipping Forecast</a> with its steady and clear voice takes our imagination out to a ship that is clinging onto a cold grey sea.</p>

<p>The Air Ministry started broadcasting its <a href="https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/learning/weather-and-history/shipping-forecast-history">weather shipping programme</a> in 1924, using 13 maritime zones, twice daily on the Home Service. It was suspended during the Second World War, but was relaunched in 1949. Today the Shipping Forecast is produced by <a href="http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/public/weather/marine-shipping-forecast">The Meterological Office</a> and it’s broadcast four times throughout the day: 5:20 am, 12.01 pm, 5.45 pm and 00.48 am. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFdas-kMF74">Sailing By</a> is a short piece of light music composed by Ronald Binge is used before the late forecast to give the helmsman time to tune in. When the late forecast is finished the National Anthem is played.</p>

<p>There are now <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/coast_and_sea/shipping_forecast">31 zones</a>, which are given out in strict order, beginning at Viking in the north-east bordering Norway, and proceeding in a clockwise direction round the British Isles. Only seven areas survive from the original list: Forties, Humber, Dogger, Thames, Wight, Shannon and Hebrides. The last change to the zones was in 2002 when Finisterre became FitzRoy, which is name of the pioneering meteorologist Admiral Robert FitzRoy and who was captain of HMS Beagle on which Charles Darwin sailed to South America.</p>

<p>The forecast is full of <a href="http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/guide/weather/marine/glossary">precise technical terms</a> that have to be decoded. For example, the terms ‘veering’ and
‘backing’ refer to the change in wind direction. When a wind is veering it is changing in a clockwise
direction, whereas backing is anti-clockwise direction. Also, ‘variable’ means winds of less than force 4 that are changing by 90 degrees and ‘cyclonic’ means there will be considerable change.</p>

<p>The rhythmic, measured pace with which the Shipping Forecast is recorded has ensured that it is a as a <a href="https://bigthink.com/strange-maps/the-shipping-forecast-the-weather-map-that-separates-britain-from-europe">cultural icon in the UK</a>. Many artists have used it in their work, and it was prominent in Danny Boyle’s London 2012 Opening Ceremony. But it is best captured by the pen of Seamus Heaney in <a href="http://commonorgarden.tumblr.com/post/3959869069/the-shipping-forecast-by-seamus-heaney">The Shipping Forecast</a>:</p>

<div class="poemwrapper">
<p>
Dogger, Rockall, Malin, Irish Sea: <br />
Green, swift upsurges, North Atlantic flux <br />
Conjured by that strong gale-warning voice, <br />
Collapse into a sibilant penumbra. <br />
Midnight and closedown. Sirens of the tundra, <br />
Of eel-road, seal-road, keel-road, whale-road, raise <br />
Their wind-compounded keen behind the baize <br />
And drive the trawlers to the lee of Wicklow. <br />
L’Etoile, Le Guillemot, La Belle Hélène <br />
Nursed their bright names this morning in the bay <br />
That toiled like mortar. It was marvellous <br />
And actual, I said out loud, ‘A haven,’ <br />
The word deepening, clearing, like the sky <br />
Elsewhere on Minches, Cromarty, The Faroes. <br />

    <p>Could sound be a form of art ?</p>

<p>Art is open to our own interpretation and it is based on our knowledge and experiences, in particular memories. Good art should be challenging and question our perceptions of both ourselves and the world that we inhabit,  and even change them. Experiencing sound can have the same impact as pictures hanging in a gallery and over the years I have gathered a number of sounds, including songs, that have opened my ears to wider appreciation of of a sonic landscape.</p>

<p><a href="http://chriswatson.net/">Chris Watson</a>, one of the world’s <a href="https://chriswatsonreleases.bandcamp.com/">leading recorders of wildlife</a> and natural phenomena, remains a constant source for going beyond sound. In the following clip entitled Winter, he creates the sonic environment of the Holy Island as it might have been experienced by <a href="https://acloserlisten.com/2013/07/30/chris-watson-in-st-cuthberts-time/">St. Cuthbert</a> in 700 A.D.( It is best to listen to this and all of the rest of the selected tracks through headphones or loudly through speakers ). Towards the end of the piece you can hear the distant ring of a prayer bell which pulls you through the space filled with the sound of the wildlife, and the cold wind, towards Holy Island and its spiritual life.</p>

<p>Sometimes a recording of the natural world captures more than was expected. On May 19 1942, three years into World War Two, the BBC was planning to broadcast the song of nightingales. During the recording they captured the sound of bombers flying overhead on their way to raids in Mannheim.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/H_MHqW5KVds" frameborder="0"></iframe>

<p>The nightingales song, which is part of their mating strategy, and signals the continuation of life, is juxtaposed with the drone of the bombers as they pass over on their deadly mission symbolises questions of life and death.</p>

<p><b>Music</b></p>

<p>Stockhausen is regarded one of the greatest composers of the 20th century, but listening to any of his work for the first time it can seem incomprehensible: full of electronic squeaks, chopped up voices fading in and out, and no sign of a a melody. But perseverance can bring great rewards!</p>

<p>In Stockhuasen’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gesang_der_J%C3%BCnglinge">Gesang der Jünglinge</a> ( Song of the Youths ),  which is taken from the apocryphal Bible text “Song of the Three Youths in the Fiery Furnace”, in which youths are tossed into a fire by King Nebuchadnezzar, but are rescued by an angel due to their faith-based song, he explores the optimism and energy of youth.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/WTtzAmZFtds" frameborder="0"></iframe>

<p>It is interesting to note that this is one of Paul McCartney’s favourite pieces which influenced his early career.</p>

<p>Stockhausen’s influence can still be heard today. In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oneohtrix_Point_Never">Oneohtrix Point Never</a>’s Chrome Country, a track with a title that could point to a landscape lacquered in mirror we hear a mix of sounds bursting with childlike voices, drifting through rapid piano sounds and builds to an organ sound which is like the triumphant end of a High Mass.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/R7XcAaVumgc?start=2280&amp;stop=2585" frameborder="0"></iframe>

<p>Of course the richness of the human voice to express something beyond music is beyond doubt. One of the best examples is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meredydd_Evans">Meredydd Evans</a>, who was collector, editor, historian and performer of folk music of Wales written in the Welsh language. Although I am not a welsh speaker, in Robin Ddiog ( Lazy Robin ) in his voice we can ‘see’ the cheekiness a robin sitting inside a house and asking us to open the door slightly so that he can see the sea:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/1K2lyb4tmxw" frameborder="0"></iframe>

<p>Sometimes a choir can catch a the strength of a community that goes beyond the everyday and in the Treorchy Welsh Male Voice Choir’s version of <a href="https://library.timelesstruths.org/music/When_I_Survey_the_Wondrous_Cross/">When I Survey The Wonderous Cross</a>. I have never been down a mine but their deep, low voices seems to sweep up from its depths into the bright sunlight:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/5Rpejn5Lwmw" frameborder="0"></iframe>

<p>I find that the clips above, and many more that have not been included, go beyond their original purpose, whether it is the <a href="http://wmich.edu/mus-gened/mus170/RockElements.pdf">melody and harmony</a> of a song or recording the detail of natural world, to catch something that is difficult to express - is that art ?</p>
