Sustainability seems to be everywhere: from fish to farming and everything in between. But what does it mean to be a 'sustainable' business ?
</p>

<p>A few years ago I watched an
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ODXzkT7Elc">interview</a>
with the famous golfer Greg Norman, whose nickname is The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Norman">Great White Shark</a>, where he discussed his career on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Norman#Great_White_Shark_Enterprises">golf course</a>.
Towards the end of the interview the discussion moved onto his success as a businessman, his estimated net worth of <a href="http://www.therichest.com/celebnetworth/athletes/golfers/greg-norman-net-worth/">$300 Million</a>. He started talking about a 12 and even a 200-year horizon for his
<a href="http://www.shark.com/">business</a>, or approximately 10 generations. Greg put forward the case that it was about creating a solid business that would support customers, employees and suppliers which would outlive his and their children’s children: a form of sustainability. So what makes a business sustainable and last for more than 200 years ?</p>

<p>Looking about for things that have been around for over 200 years there are many examples outside of business: stately homes, castles and estates.
Then there are the ancient trees that have weathered many storms for hundreds of years but are facing their greatest storm from pollution and global warming! However in the world of
business there are a few <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_oldest_companies">companies</a>
that are still going after 200 years of economic turbulence, wars, and major social change. Some produce my favourite products:
<a href="https://www.shepherdneame.co.uk/">Shepard Neames</a>, brewer since 1698, with their wonderful beer: Spitfire and Bishops Finger, and
<a href="http://www.mornflake.com/home/">Mornflakes</a>, oats and cereals since 1675, that get me started every morning.  Are there any common threads from these examples?</p>

<p>A clue to sustainability started to take shape in my mind during a discussion with a teacher about initiative overload. In particular how many government sponsored initiatives lack any sustainability, and when the money dried up they faded out. During our discussion he said that to be sustainable it needs to affect the core activities which in eduction is reading, writing and arithmetic - or the ‘3Rs’. If it didn’t then it quickly disappeared and the next initiative rolled in.</p>

<p>Drawing a few threads together from business and eduction some rough conclusions can be drawn. First, businesses longevity depends on a core product e.g. food and drink - something that everybody needs regularly and is an integral part of life. Packaging may change, marketing channels redirected but the core product will have been the basically the same for hundreds of years. Secondly, businesses that are still going after 200 years appear to be run by families, which suggests that the core values of the business, and the deep understanding of customers, markets and competition, are more easily passed onto subsequent generations. Finally, every business uses some form of technology and as far as I can establish a sustainable business understands the importance of using just enough to improve its performance. Just a few conclusions but I am sure that many more can be drawn from analysing 200+ year old businesses.</p>

<p>I hope that Greg Norman’s business is still around in 200 years so that my great-great-great-great-great-great-grandchildren can play golf !</p>

    <p>
<b>PRESS RELEASE - 7 October 1702</b>
</p>

<p>
The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences has decided to award the Noble Prize in Physics
for 1702 to
</p>

<p>
<b><font size="4">Isaac Newton</font></b><br />
Cambridge University, Cambridge,<br />
United Kingdom
</p>

<p><i>
“for the invention of a mathematical foundation in natural philosophy which led to the
discovery of a universal force, gravity, which applies to all objects in all parts of the
universe.”
</i></p>

<p>
This year’s Noble Laureate is rewarded for answering the question: how does a force make a body move ?
This fundamental question covers every object in the Universe from cups on a table to the planets in the Heavens. Newton’s breakthrough was to develop a new mathematical approach:
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus">the calculus</a>, that he successfully used to reason
about the forces on a body and its resulting motion.
</p>

<p>
In his work Newton developed three laws of motion. The first states that a body will stay at rest, or
remain in uniform motion in a straight line, unless a force acts upon it: a cannonball resting on the
ground will remain stationary, however as it flies through the air both the forces of air resistance and
gravity will bring it back to the earth. Newton also reasoned that the force applied to the object is
equal to its mass times its acceleration, which is his second law of motion. For example, the force from the exploding gunpowder in a cannon accelerates the cannonball through the air. The greater the explosion the faster the cannon ball flies towards its target. Finally, when a cannon is fired, the cannon will be pushed backwards a yard or two. This action and reaction is described by Newton’s third law, which states that every action has an equal, and opposite reaction.
</p>

<p>
Newton’s work cumulated in an answer to the question of why objects fall to earth. Using the insights on
the motion of bodies his answer identified a new force called gravity. He showed that gravity is an attractive force between bodies. The Earth, which is a very massive body, will exert a force on an apple, a relatively tiny
body, as it hangs on a tree. The gravitational force is pulling the apple to the earth and the earth is
being pulled towards apple ! Newton then reasoned that the same force is acting like a web on the planets, holding them in the Heavens, and stopping them from crashing into the Earth. He went on to develop a mathematical relationship for the gravitational force that involved the mass of the bodies and their distance apart from each other. Newton took this result and solved many outstanding problems, for example the deflection of the planet’s orbit around the sun by the pull of the its gravity, and the gravitational pull of the moon and sun to explain the ocean tides.
</p>

<p>
The Noble Committee agreed that the intellectual break through, and subsequent discoveries, made by Sir Issac Newton would benefit mankind for many years into the future.

    <p>
There is a danger when recommending books on a subject: too difficult and the reader will not get
past the first few pages, too easy and they will start to get bored and wonder why they should bother. This fine line becomes precarious when recommending books about the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein.
</p>

<p>Wittgenstein attracts a lot of attention: he gave away a fortune that he inherited
from his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Wittgenstein">millionaire father</a>; was <a href="https://trinitycollegelibrarycambridge.wordpress.com/2014/07/11/wwi-wittgenstein/">decorated for valour</a> for his service on the Eastern front and against the British army during the First Wold War; was a <a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/aboutkings/history/flashback/porteringphilosophy.aspx">hospital porter</a>; a <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Wittgenstein.html">gardener’s assistant</a> in a monastery; designed a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haus_Wittgenstein">house in the modernist</a> style for his sister in Vienna and at one time thought about being a monk. Against the background of his life he is considered by many to have been one of the greatest philosophers of the 20th century ( Bertrand Russell being the other ).  His life and work has generated over two thousand books, a large number of web sites, and what feels like a library full of academic papers. It is very easy to get lost in the growing material! However, the following books I have found helpful in developing my understanding of Wittgenstein’s work.</p>

<p>The first book that I would recommend is <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Principles_of_Linguistic_Philosophy.html?id=Eg4bAAAAIAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y">The Principles of Linguistic Philosophy</a> by Frederich Waismann. The early chapters describe how philosophical problems arise and gives an overview of Wittgenstein’s solutions in non-technical language.</p>

<p>There are many general books on philosophy that have a section on Wittgenstein, but one of the most accessible is the chapter with John Searle ( pg 322 - 347 ) in
Bryan Magee’s <a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8WjmtRd5OzgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Great+Philosophers&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZPFHVJa2NdGM7AaXroHwBA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Great%20Philosophers&amp;f=false">The Great Philosophers</a>
which gives a short and clear overview of his two works the <i><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/5740/5740-pdf.pdf">Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus</a></i> ( known as the <i>Tractatus</i> ) and the
<i><a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/54889e73e4b0a2c1f9891289/t/564b61a4e4b04eca59c4d232/1447780772744/Ludwig.Wittgenstein.-.Philosophical.Investigations.pdf">Philosophical Investigations</a></i>.
Another accessible book is
<a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=lsBafUQtR58C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Great+Philosophers&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZPFHVJa2NdGM7AaXroHwBA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Great%20Philosophers&amp;f=false">The Great Philosophers</a> by Stephen Law which includes a clearly written section on
Wittgenstein’s <i>Philosophical Investigations</i> ( pg 156 - 161 ).</p>

<p>A short introduction to Wittgenstein’s life and work is Norman Malcolm’s
<a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Wof3oAEACAAJ&amp;dq=Ludwig+Wittgenstein+A+Memoir&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=B_JHVPyPAcKv7AaTj4G4Cw&amp;redir_esc=y">Ludwig Wittgenstein A Memoir</a>.
Malcolm was one Wittgenstein’s students and he gives a fascinating insight into his character. A more extensive book about Wittgenstein is Ray Monk’s
<a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bYIZyldMZL8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Duty+of+Genius&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TfJHVJHREqy17gay6IGYCg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Duty%20of%20Genius&amp;f=false">The Duty of Genius</a>.</p>

<p>To get a flavour of Wittgenstein’s solutions to philosophical problems, A. C. Graylings’s book
<a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kYUFhlIRZA4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Wittgenstein+A+Very+Short+Introduction&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jvJHVMTZI6be7AaM3oHYCA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Wittgenstein%20A%20Very%20Short%20Introduction&amp;f=false">Wittgenstein A Very Short Introduction</a> gives enough detail to start understanding Wittgenstein’s approach to philosophical problems.</p>

<p>There are many specialised introductions for the <i>Tractatus</i> and <i>Philosophical
Investigations</i> but Ray Monk’s
<a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=pkDcFBOGEUAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=How+To+Read+Wittgenstein&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6fJHVM_HIKSE7gbsyYBY&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=How%20To%20Read%20Wittgenstein&amp;f=false">How To Read Wittgenstein</a>, explains passages from his work in a way that is understandable. Another short introduction to Wittgenstein’s approach to solving philosophical problems is
<a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=M8pbQscyObgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Great+Philosophers+Wittgenstein&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4fRHVIvFKM2p7AaK9YCgDw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Great%20Philosophers%20Wittgenstein&amp;f=false">Wittgenstein</a> by P. M. S. Hacker ( part of the The Great Philosophers
series ) which contains a section on whether a machine, in particular computers, can think ( very topical for todays world with the heated debates about Artificial Intelligence ).</p>

<p>The book that I first read about Wittgenstein, following a recommendation by a philosopher specialising in his work, was  <a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mDy2UvPJ9xoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Wittgenstein+Anthony+Kenny&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cPNHVOahLoSxPJyWgMgI&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Wittgenstein%20Anthony%20Kenny&amp;f=false">Wittgenstein</a>
by Anthony Kenny, which I regularly refer to.</p>

<p>A good preparation for reading Wittgenstein’s work directly ( he only published the <i>Tractatus</i> in his own life time but there are several books of his notes ), is
<a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ayODpqsr6JwC&amp;dq=Wittgenstein%27s++Tractatus+an+Introduction&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=BvRHVJD9HrKv7Abgl4HwDA&amp;redir_esc=y">Wittgenstein’s Tractatus an Introduction</a>
by H. O Mounce, and Marie McGinn’s
<a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DK6anQEACAAJ&amp;dq=Wittgenstein+and+the+Philosophical+Investigations+McGinn&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=b_RHVLvODYrC7Aag0oC4Cw&amp;redir_esc=y">Wittgenstein and the Philosophical Investigations</a>.
Both books are not easy to read but with perseverance then his work should start to make sense.</p>

<p>Hopefully the above will help you navigate through the forest of material about Wittgenstein -
Good Luck!</p>

  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data">Big Data </a> is the big news. Many businesses, universities and other organisations are investing large amounts of money into developing technology that exploits the many pieces of data that
we generate from our lives. In amongst the marketing frenzy for Big Data I came across<br />
the term
<a href="https://www.brandwatch.com/2014/04/what-is-thick-data-and-why-should-you-use-it/">
Thick Data </a> which has been coined to cover a deeper look at the context within which data is gathered.  I was intrigued and imagined a big pot of data stew being stirred with a thickening agent !</p>

<p>Trying to find an agreed definition for Thick Data has proved impossible. However summing and averaging the various definitions found on the web, I arrived at: Thick Data is data gathered about our behavior and underlying motivations. Traditionally the data has been gathered through surveys, questionnaires,
focus groups, interviews, journals, videos and so on and gathered and interpreted by analysed by ethnographers ( the study of people and cultures and how they change ) and anthropologists ( the study of various aspects of humans within past and present societies ). Compared to the people who collect and analyse Big Data ( they often sit in IT functions with analytical degrees), there is a large gap between the two groups.</p>

<p>How could Big Data be thickened ? What capability would computer technology have to achieve
to add context to data ?</p>

<p>In Clifford Geertz’ paper
<a href="http://philpapers.org/archive/GEETTD.pdf">
Thick Description: Toward an Interpretive Theory of Culture</a>
he describes a situation challenge that computer technology would have to overcome to thicken data ( if you are interested in anthropology and ethnography then the whole paper is worth reading ):
“… two boys rapidly contracting the eyelids of their right eyelids of their eyes. In one,
this is an involuntary twitch, the other a conspiratorial signal to a friend. The two movements
are, as movements, identical, from an I-am-a-camera, “phenomomenalistic” observation of them alone, one could not tell which was twitch and which was wink. Yet the difference, however
unphotographicable, between twitch and a wink is vast, as anyone unfortunate enough to have had
the first taken for the second knows. The winker is communicating, and indeed in a precise way:
(1) deliberately, (2) to someone in particular, (3) impart a particular message, (4) according
to socially established code, and (5) without of the cognizance of the rest of the company.”</p>

<p>Current computer technology can capture and analysis eye movement, and possibly distinguish a wink from normal eyelid movement, but can not interpret the communication of a wink. Also, computer technology has developed to a point where emotions
can be captured ( see the
<a href="http://www.myfeel.co/">Feel Wrist Band</a> ) and levels of motivation
can be measured ( usually measured against set goals ). However, gathering data to analyse the social context, as described in the passage above, has a long way to go.</p>

<p>The challenge for both computer technologists, and sociologists is: what developments in computer technology are required to gather thick data to enable a greater insight into our behaviours and motivations?</p>

    <p>
Over the years of blogging I have learned many lessons. The following are the ones that I return to when my writing has lost its way.
</p>

<p><b>1. Why do you want to write a blog?</b></p>

<p>Large amount of time and energy go into into writing a blog and therefore it is important to be clear about the motivation behind the effort. Motivation can range from communicating the development of a business to establishing the author as a ‘thought leader’ about a particular subject.</p>

<p><b>2. Who is the target audience?</b></p>

<p>It is important to identify the target audience - the people who are going to regularly read the blog. There is nothing worse than spending hours producing a post that isn’t going to be read!</p>

<p><b>3. Why would the target audience want to read the blog?</b></p>

<p>What is the subject, or subjects, that the target audience are going to find interesting. How will the subject, or subjects, be used by the target audience, for example will it inform their business decisions?</p>

<p><b>4. How will the target audience find the blog?</b></p>

<p>Which communication channels will be used to promote the blog e.g. Twitter, recommendations by other bloggers, Search Engine Optimisation ( SEO ), targeting specific groups with tailored e-mails etc.</p>

<p><b>5. What frequency should the posts be published?</b></p>

<p>Everybody is busy and therefore how often will the target audience want to take a few minutes out to read the blog i.e once a week, once a month? Take into account the amount of time it will take to write a post and not churn them out too frequently so that the quality reduces - they need to remain fresh!</p>

<p><b>6. What format should the blogs take? </b></p>

<p>The format needs to make reading the blog as easy as possible, for example what will be the best mix of graphics and text? The type of blogs that I am interested in is of the written form. However, many bloggers use videos which will require a different set of skills.</p>

<p><b>7. What style should the blog have?</b></p>

<p>Will the blog be opinionated? - if so will it be balanced or take one side? Or will it be informative in which case if it is using technical terminology then the level of knowledge of the target audience will need to be taken into account. Also, what “voice” should the author take?</p>

<p><b>8. How many words should a typical post be?</b></p>

<p>Length of the blog is important because reading it has to fit into the busy lives of the target audience. Should it be short and too the point or be a long full of detailed analysis?</p>

<p><b>9. What will be the process required to develop the posts?</b></p>

<p><b>a. Gathering Ideas</b></p>

<p>There are any number of sources for gathering ideas for a post: newspapers, magazines, journals, radio, TV, tweets, conversations, blogs etc. Other sources are:  art exhibitions, museums, sport and theatre. The key point at this stage is to jot them down with a few lines about why they are interesting ( I use Google Documents on my smart phone but a pen and notebook is just as effective ).</p>

<p><b>b. Selecting An Idea To Develop</b></p>

<p>Set a deadline for each post which helps at the editing stage where time pressure can sharpen up a post. The following questions can be used to guide topic selection:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>What is the central message of the post ?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why is the message important ? Will it be useful, new, counterintuitive, or build on previous work ? If the message is exploring a new idea ( whether technological, social, business etc ) then what is it going to change ?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What credibility does the author have to support the views expressed in the message ? e.g. previous work, personal experience, academic or professional ?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>At this point draft a single sentence about what the post is about which will eventually be used as the summary. Also, start to think about an eye catching title that is relevant to the post.</p>

<p><b>c. The First Draft(s)</b></p>

<p>The purpose of the drafts at this stage is try and sharpen up the subject of the post. After several drafts it may not be clear but it is important to persevere. Sometimes it doesn’t become clear and then the idea goes back on the shelf until it has developed more.</p>

<p><b>d. <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/ks3/english/reading/character/revision/5/">Point of View</a></b></p>

<p>It is important to be clear what the relationship between the author and the reader - what is the perspective that the post is being written ?</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>First Person - you are writing about yourself and using words such as “I”, “me”,”my” and “mine”. But can also invovle “We”, “Us” and “Our”.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Second Person - you are addressing the reader directly and using “you”, “your” and “yours”.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Third Person - you are telling the reader and using words such as “he”, “she”,”it” and “they”.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><b>e. Editing</b></p>

<p>People can view editing as a ‘slash and burn’ process as their work is cut and changed. However, it as an important part in the creative process.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Grammar - is the thought being expressed in each sentence clearly expressed ? Are nouns, verbs etc. used correctly ? Are the aspects of time - past, present, and future - consistent ?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Paragraphs - are the paragraphs clearly linked ?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Title - is it eye catching enough for the reader to read further ?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Single sentence summary - does the single sentence that is displayed accurately cover the post ? Can the number of words be reduced further ?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tags - are the tags cover the key points in the post ?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Length - my posts are aimed at a quick read ( maybe over a coffee ? ) therefore the length needs to be somewhere around 500 - 700 words.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><b>10. How will feedback be gathered and used about the blog’s readership?</b></p>

<p>Apart from using Google Analytics to gather the frequency of readership ( which could be used to set targets ), adding comment capabilities to the blog allows direct feedback to be captured. Finally, how will regular communication the target audience be managed? - email subscriptions?</p>
