<p>In Lilly Coleâ€™s book <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Who_Cares_Wins.html?id=QTpfDwAAQBAJ&amp;redir_esc=y">Who Cares Wins: Reason For Optimisim in Our Changing World</a> she recounts a story when Maria Carter was asked by her school to write about an environmental solution. She handed in something surprising. whilste mose kids wrote about atking a shorter shower or using energy-efficient light bulbs, Maria submitted advice on knife sharpening.</p>

<p>Mariaâ€™s farter, Murray Carter, is a seventeeth- generation Yoshimoto bladesmith. Originally Canadian, he spent eighteen years in Japan learning the ancient craft of smelting and forge- welding stell blades, and carving wooden handle. eventually he was asked by his teacher Mr Sakemotosensei to become the first non-Japanese Yoshimoto bladesmithj.</p>

<p>Maria explained that it takes a lot of resources to make a knife - stell from iron ore, coal furnaces, wood or plastic - but when they become dull, they often end up in landfills where most of th eplastic handles will rake centuries to biograde. Yet as Maria points out, â€˜Most knives can be sharpened ( and reused for decades ) until the blade disappears!. Buying one great knife, and learning to sharpen it - maybe even to love it - offers a radically conscious act.â€™</p>

<p>There are a number of things interesting about this story.  There are a number of routes to getting rid of <a href="https://www.nisbets.co.uk/how-to-dispose-of-knives">knives in the UK</a> and <a href="https://www.staffordshire.gov.uk/Waste-and-recycling/Types-of-waste/Kitchen-knife.aspx">local governments advice</a> is to take to the metal scrap bin at the local waste recycling centre ( either bin or waste disposal sites ).</p>

<p>However, there is a big and deeper question and that is why. In the case of a knive why donâ€™t people resharpen their knives - is it too much effort or is it percieved to be to difficult a skill to master.  even <a href="https://youtu.be/nWyhDizhS0I">Jamie Oliver has a video</a> on how to sharpen a knife.</p>

<p>the implied question in the piece about the kinfe is â€˜whyâ€™ why do people through away knives as well as anything else that heads its way to landfill sites etc. the question why can be asked about all of the other issues related to waste e.g. why do people over consume?, why do people not repair things? etc.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Need to ask why people do not do any of the follwoing - is it because of convenience, lack of time or money?</li>
</ul>

<p>Reduce - consumption but it is varied for example there are <a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/social-policy/welfare-pensions/what-do-the-latest-food-bank-statistics-tell-us/#:~:text=There%20are%20just%20over%202%2C000,the%20Independent%20Food%20Aid%20Network.">over 2000 foodbanks in the UK</a></p>

<p>Repair - the knife example is a good example of â€˜repairâ€™ i.e sharpening it. How about repairing a bicycle, dishwasher, car etc. as well as cloths.</p>

<p>Recycle - glass milk bottles - but glass going to recycling directly back to the manufacturer.</p>

<p>Repurpose ( to find a new use for an old item ) - money for nothing.</p>

<p>Replace - using alternatives <a href="https://friendsoftheearth.uk/natural-resources/all-you-need-know-about-waste-and-recycling">see Friends of the earth</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.groundsure.com/resources/the-reducing-landfill-capacity-in-the-uk/">The reducing landfill capacity in the UK</a> - An Environmental Services Association report in 2017 claimed that by 2030 there will be a household waste capacity deficit of 6 million tonnes. Although, previous predictions havenâ€™t been accurate (Grice, 2010).</p>

<p><a href="https://www.recyclingbins.co.uk/recycling-facts/#:~:text=This%20means%20that%20the%20average,average%20recycling%20rate%20of%2045%25.">THE STATE OF THE NATION: RECYCLING IN THE UK</a></p>
<ul>
  <li>A report released by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) earlier this year, revealed that British households create over 26m tonnes of waste each year, the weight of around 260 large cruise ships.
This means that the average person in the UK throws away around 400kg of waste each year; 7 times their body weight.
Of the 26m tonnes of waste produced in the UK, 12m tonnes are recycled, and 14m tonnes are sent to landfill sites. This gives us an average recycling rate of 45%.
While we recycle around 44% of our waste in England, some of our neighbours are doing better, with Wales recycling 57% of its waste and Northern Ireland recycling 46%. Scotland falls slightly behind England, recycling 43% of household waste.
Germany, Austria, and South Korea remain world-leaders when it comes to recycling household waste, recycling 60 â€“ 70%.
In the UK, we are only recycling 3% more waste than we did in 2010.
The UK government has set a target for us to recycle 50% of all household waste by 2020.</li>
