I"á<p>Risk has hit the media in connection with the side effects of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca">Oxford-AstraZenica vaccine</a>. But in the discussion about the risk of <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n774">blood clots</a> the benefits of the vaccine have been drowned out.  The media always concentrates on risk, after all it makes good headlines, but what are we missing when the benefits are not included in the discussion?</p>

<p>Every activity that we undertake has benefits and risks. To get a better balance between the two I have developed the following <a href="https://www.health.org.uk/blogs/ask-three-questions">questions</a>:</p>

<p><b>What is the activity I would like to undertake?</b> It is important to understand everything that is involved in an activity so that a sensible of assessment of the benefits and risks can be made. For example when I started cycling I learned about what is involved by cycling around in a safe area, in this case our backyard, and also passed my cycling proficiency test at school before I put my foot on the pedal and headed for the big open roads.</p>

<p><b>What are the benefits and possible risks?</b> There are many benefits from cycling such as a good nights sleep! Amongst the <a href="https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/healthyliving/cycling-health-benefits#cycling-for-health-and-fitness">health benefits</a>  with improvements in the fitness of my heart, increased muscle strength and flexibility and improved mobility in my joints. There are also many <a href="https://mensline.org.au/mens-mental-health/cycling-positive-mental-health/">mental health benefits</a>. For example there is what is called the ‚Äúcycling high‚Äù which comes from Cycling pumps blood around your body at a greater rate which allows for the rapid spread of endorphins and other good substances which promotes positive mental health. It has a positive effect on self-Esteem, depression, anxiety and stress are all positively affected through exercise, and has been shown to be more effective than other forms of exercise. I find that cycling can be a great way to get life back into perspective, a form of ‚Äúzoning out‚Äù or even meditation.</p>

<p>On the risk side of the balance there is the possibility of being knocked off your bike by a vehicle, which tends to happen  what I call a ‚Äòclose encounter‚Äô.  This tends to happen at junctions or roundabouts or when a driver miss judges their distance between us. Or skidding on dangerous surfaces such as black ice on a road which has happened to me.  However, these risks can be reduced by wearing a helmet, avaoind main roads, wearing highly visible clothing and avoiding poor road conditions.</p>

<p><b>How likely are these benefits and risks?</b>  There is enough information in the public domaoin either in the newspapers such as <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cycling/family-routes/health-benefits/">Eight healthy reasons why you should go cycling this summer</a> or scientifically supported <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-top-5-benefits-of-cycling">The top 5 benefits of cycling</a> from Harvard Medical School support the benefits that are likelky form cycling.  On the risk side there are statics there is information such as the follwoing from the Q<a href="https://ig.ft.com/sites/urban-cycling/">FT - is urban cycling worth the risk - 2016</a>, based on data from 2015 - ‚ÄúMile by mile, people in the UK are actually more likely to die walking than cycling, according to figures from the Department for Transport. For every billion miles cycled last year, <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/533293/rrcgb-main-results-2015.pdf">30.9 cyclists were killed</a>, while 35.8 pedestrians were killed for every billion miles walked.</p>

<p>In the national conversation we need a balanced view on the benefits and risks associated with any activity that we want to carryout whether its is cycling, vaccination for Covid or even activities that moving job, house, buying a car we take for granted such as eating and drinking.</p>
