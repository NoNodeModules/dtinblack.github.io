</p>

<p>Fly fishing is trying to trick a fish, normally trout or salmon, into eating something that is made to look like a food.  The skill is to place an artificial fly in front of a trout at the point where it is hungry enough to wrap its mouth around it. Sounds simple but after many years of trying to outwit one of the wildest animals on the planet they are still ahead of me on cunning.</p>

<p>On the surface there may appear to be many barriers to fly fishing. For example, the world of fly fishing may look like a totally male-dominated activity, however there is a long legacy of female anglers. Women have been involved in angling in one way or another for many centuries. Dame Juliana Verna wrote a book called <a href="http://flyfishingattheriver.com/fishing.html">Treatise on the Angle</a> published in 1497. In recent times <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Wulff">Joan Wulff</a> who pioneered casting techniques is still fishing at <a href="https://www.anglersjournal.com/freshwater/virtuoso">89</a>. There are many more <a href="https://www.blueridgeoutdoors.com/fly-fishing/fly-females-meet-six-women-revolutionizing-the-sport/">women revolutionising fly fishing </a> as well as increasing numbers of women‚Äôs clubs for example <a href="http://www.norfolkflyfishing.com/blog/fly-fishing-uk/fly-fishing-women/">Fly Fishing Women</a>, and a successful health initiative <a href="https://castingforrecovery.org/">Casting for Recovery</a> whose mission ‚Äúis to enhance the quality of women with breast cancer through a unique retreat program that combines breast cancer education and peer support with the therapeutic sport of fly fishing.‚Äù Age is no barrier either, with initiatives such as <a href="http://www.charlesjardine.co.uk/fishingforschools.html">Fishing for schools</a> and <a href="http://www.paas.co.uk/junior-development/">The Prince Albert Angling Society Junior Section</a> and at the other end of the age spectrum there are courses run By <a href="https://www.ageuk.org.uk/bp-assets/globalassets/somerset/original-blocks/activities-and-events/fly-fishing-poster.pdf">Age UK</a>.</p>

<p>For many people contemplating fly fishing a big question looms - what do I do when I catch the fish? do I have to kill it? No. The vast majority of fish are returned to the water, and because of their experience of being caught, are even more aware of strange looking flies and therefore more difficult to catch. Unhooking a fish must be one of the great experiences in life as you hold a wild animal for a few seconds before letting it go back into its own world.</p>

<p>Of course weather is an issue. On a bright spring morning standing on a lakeside it could be something straight out of a Constable painting. But it can be wet and windy. However with the proper clothing you can carry on fishing which makes a cup of tea and piece of cake at the end of the day even more delicious! Or you can do what I do which is shelter in below a tree and wait for the rain clouds to pass over; spending the time thinking about my next tactic to catch that trout.</p>

<p>Cost can be an issue but for a few hundred pound a rod, line and a box of flies can get you started. It is important to add to the list some form of glasses to protect your eyes from an erratic fly during casting and some head gear to protect from the sun, or in my case, a fly sticking in my head. However, there is one thing that is a must and that is proper coaching. A few hours with an <a href="https://www.aapgai.co.uk/">accredited</a> <a href="https://gameanglinginstructors.co.uk/">trainer</a> can make sure that you fish safely bad habits are not adopted.</p>

<p><b>New Conclusions and closing</b></p>

<p>In summary there are lots of health benefits from fly fishing. Therefore my call to the medical professionals is that instead of reaching for a programme of drugs, or activities with strange sounding names, why not prescribe some fly fishing for long term health benefits?</p>
