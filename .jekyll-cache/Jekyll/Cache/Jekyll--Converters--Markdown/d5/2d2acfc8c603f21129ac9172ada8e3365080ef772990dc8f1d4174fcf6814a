I"8<p>The subject of risk has hit the media in connection with the side effects of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca">Oxford-AstraZenica vaccine</a>. But the benefits of the vaccine are being drowned out by the general chatter about the risk of <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n774">blood clots</a>. Risk makes good headlines but are we missing out when the benefits are not included in the discussion?</p>

<p>Every activity that we undertake has both benefits and risks. We are usually motivated by the benefits whether it is joining a fitness club to improve our health, moving job for a better career or having an annual vaccination to prevent serious illness. To get a better balance between the benefits and risk I have developed the following <a href="https://www.health.org.uk/blogs/ask-three-questions">questions</a>:</p>

<p><b>What is the activity I would like to undertake?</b> It is important to understand as much as possible what is involved in an activity so that a sensible of assessment of the benefits and risks can be made. For example when I started cycling I learned about what is involved with cycling by peddling around in the safety of our backyard: learning how to keep my balance without falling off, which took a few goes, braking to avoid a wall and learning what can go wrong when cycling too fast.  I also passed my cycling proficiency test at school before I put my foot on the pedal and headed for the big open roads. Understanding a new activity may involve different approaches such as finding out about it on the web, asking friends or work colleagues, paying for some coaching, or just giving it a go in a safe environment.</p>

<p><b>What are the benefits and possible risks?</b> Continuing with the example of cycling there are many <a href="https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/healthyliving/cycling-health-benefits#cycling-for-health-and-fitness">benefits</a>: increased cardiovascular fitness, increased muscle strength and flexibility. There are also
<a href="https://mensline.org.au/mens-mental-health/cycling-positive-mental-health/">mental health benefits</a> which comes from what is called the “cycling high” which increases the circulation of endorphins and improves mood, memory, self-esteem and helps with a better quality of sleep. There is information in the public domain to support the benefits and in the case of cycling there are newspaper articles such as <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cycling/family-routes/health-benefits/">Eight healthy reasons why you should go cycling this summer</a> or scientifically supported information such as <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-top-5-benefits-of-cycling">The top 5 benefits of cycling</a> from Harvard Medical School.</p>

<p>On the risk side of the balance there there is the possibility of being hit by a vehicle. This tends to happen at junctions, roundabouts, crossings or when a driver doesn’t give a cyclist enough space on the road. Another risk comes from skidding on dangerous road surfaces such as black ice or wet leaves. These risks can be reduced by wearing a helmet, avoiding main roads, wearing highly visible clothing and a helmet. Being aware of other road users and  alert to road conditions can reduce the risk of having an accident. <a href="https://ig.ft.com/sites/urban-cycling/">Statistics</a> can be found to assess the risk such as when compared on a mile for mile basis people in the UK are more likely to die from walking than cycling.</p>

<p>Answering the questions above should gather enough information to make a balanced decision about the benefits and risk of a new activity. They can be applied to any new activity whether it is sending a rocket to mars, taking up a new sport or whether to buy an electric car. They can even be used on activities that we take for granted such as what we eat and drink.</p>

<p>We are being robbed of many new activities by media headlines about risk. These new activities could broaden our horizons, improve our health and make life more exciting!</p>
