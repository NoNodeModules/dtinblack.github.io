I"À<p>The subject of risk has hit the media in connection with the side effects of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca">Oxford-AstraZenica vaccine</a>. But the benefits of the vaccine are being drowned out by the general chatter about the risk of <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n774">blood clots</a>. Risk makes good headlines but are we missing out when the benefits are not included in the discussion?</p>

<p>Every activity that we undertake has both benefits and risks. We are usually motivated by the benefits whether it is joining a fitness club to improve our health, moving job for a better career or having an annual vaccination to prevent serious illness. To get a better balance between the benefits and risk I have developed the following <a href="https://www.health.org.uk/blogs/ask-three-questions">questions</a>:</p>

<p><b>What is the activity I would like to undertake?</b> It is important to understand as much as possible what is involved in an activity so that a sensible of assessment of the benefits and risks can be made. For example when I started cycling I learned about what is involved by cycling around in a safe area, in this case our backyard. I also passed my cycling proficiency test at school before I put my foot on the pedal and headed for the big open roads. Understanding a new activity may involve different approaches such as finding out about it on the web, asking friends or work colleagues. what is involved in a particular activity.</p>

<p><b>What are the benefits and possible risks?</b> Continuing with the example of cycling there are many <a href="https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/healthyliving/cycling-health-benefits#cycling-for-health-and-fitness">benefits</a>: increased cardiovascular fitness, increased muscle strength and flexibility and improved mobility in joints. There are also many
<a href="https://mensline.org.au/mens-mental-health/cycling-positive-mental-health/">mental health benefits</a> such as what is called the ‚Äúcycling high‚Äù which comes from increases in endorphins which improves mood, memory, self-esteem and helps you sleep better. Finally, it has been shown that cycling is more effective than other forms of exercise.</p>

<p>On the risk side of the balance there there is the possibility of being hit by a vehicle. This tends to happen at junctions, roundabouts, crossings or when a driver doesn‚Äôt give a cyclist enough space on the road. Another risk comes from skidding on dangerous road surfaces such as black ice or wet leaves. These risks can be reduced by wearing a helmet, avoiding main roads, which usually takes you through some great countryside, and wearing highly visible clothing and a helmet. Finally being aware of other road users and  alert to road conditions can reduce the risk of having an accident.</p>

<p><b>How likely are these benefits and risks?</b>  There is enough information in the public domain either in the newspapers, social media or scientific reports about the likely benefits and risks of an activity. In the case of cycling there are newspaper articles such as <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cycling/family-routes/health-benefits/">Eight healthy reasons why you should go cycling this summer</a> or scientifically supported <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-top-5-benefits-of-cycling">The top 5 benefits of cycling</a> from Harvard Medical School which provide lots of informtion.  On the risk side there are <a href="https://ig.ft.com/sites/urban-cycling/">statistics</a> such as when compared on a mile for mile basis people in the UK are more likely to die from walking than cycling.</p>

<p>Answering the three questions above should gather enough information to make a balanced decision about the benefits and risk of a new activity. They can be applied to any activity whether it is taking a vaccination to prevent serious illness, a different fitness regime to improve health or whether to move job. They can even be used on activities that we take for granted such as what we eat and drink. We are being robbed of many activities by media headlines about risk that would broaden our horizons, improve our health and make life more exciting.</p>
