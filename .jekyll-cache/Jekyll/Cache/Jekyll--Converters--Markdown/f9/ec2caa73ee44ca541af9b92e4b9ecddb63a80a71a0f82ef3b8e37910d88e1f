I"í<p>Fly fishing has taken me to many scenic parts of the country and when the fish were not biting I can spend time watching the wildlife going about its business. A days fishing puts the complexity of life into perspective but what are the benefits for my <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/stress-anxiety-depression/improve-mental-wellbeing/">health</a>?</p>

<p>Fly fishing is trying to trick a fish, normally trout, grayling or salmon, into eating something that is made to look like a fly. The fly is made to look something that the fish would normally eat. The skill is to locate the fish then place an artificial fly in front of a trout at the point where it can see it and is hungry enough to wrap its mouth around it. Sounds simple but after many years of trying to outwit one of the wildest animals on the planet they are still ahead of on cunning.</p>

<p><b>The health benefits of fresh air</b></p>

<p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/doctors-prescribing-fresh-air-boost-14252853">Doctors are prescribing fresh air to boost patientsâ€™ health and wellbeing</a></p>

<p>After a days fishing I feel much better both physically and mentally. This feeling is supported by studies which have shown the many benefits from standing in the <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/tk-ways-fresh-air-impacts_0_n_5648164">fresh air</a>: a reduction in exposure to pollution, boosting the immune system, increase in energy and is a source of Vitamin D which increases the protection from bone problems, heart disease and diabetics. Spending a day out in the fresh air, no matter what the weather is doing always makes the evening meal taste that bit better.</p>

<p><b>Heath benefits of moving</b></p>

<p>{ difference between fly fishing to other forms of fishing is that you are always  on the move }</p>

<p>Because the trout usually are aware of what I am up to they quickly move away and I have to follow. All this <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/body/health-benefits-walking/">walking</a> has been shown to help fight dementia, cut the risk of dying from cancer, and helps improve heart muscles. Another benefit is from walking on rough and slippery surface on the edge of a lake pr wadding in a river. It has been shown that it <a href="https://www.rodalesorganiclife.com/wellbeing/fly-fishing-health-benefits">improves balance and coordination </a>. Then there is the cast and re-cast which is the balletic movement of the arm, rod and flick of the line out across the water which keeps muscles strong gets the heart beating. When a fish has been hooked it pulls and tugs on the line with a great force and although it isnâ€™t <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-intensity_interval_training">High Intensity Training</a> my heart is always thumping against my ribs.</p>

<p><b>Mental benefits of fly fishing<b></b></b></p>

<p><a href="https://www.nhs.uk/news/mental-health/green-exercise-and-mental-health/">â€˜Green exerciseâ€™ and mental health</a> - improvements in self-esteem and mood,</p>

<p>Apart from the physical benefits there are mental health benefits from fly fishing. Watching for movement of the fly, or just trying to spot a trout, requires lots of concentration. There are no studies about the effect of concentration on <a href="http://neuro.hms.harvard.edu/harvard-mahoney-neuroscience-institute/brain-newsletter/and-brain-series/fly-fishing-and-brain">benefits for mental health, most fisherman</a> when I chat to report that their worries are shut out by watching for the twitch of the fly ( could this be a form of <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/stress-anxiety-depression/mindfulness/">mindfullness</a>?). Another aspect is the reduction in stress. In a 2009 study by a team of researchers from the <a href="https://www.battlecreek.va.gov/features/Project_Healing_Water.asp">University of Southern Maine, the University of Utah, and the VA in Salt Lake City</a> they found that combat veterans had significant reductions in stress and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms along with improvements in sleep quality after participating in fly fishing, for example the <a href="https://projecthealingwaters.org/">Project Healing Waters Fly Fishing</a>.</p>

<p>I would add to the list of benefits from fly fishing is the activity of learning. There are lots to learn: understanding how fish live, the impact of weather on their feeding habits, casting technique, tying flies, tying knots, etc. which is an ongoing process. Studies have shown that
<a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/stress-anxiety-depression/learn-for-mental-wellbeing/">learning new skills can improves mental wellbeing</a> in particular learning can boost self-confidence, self-esteem, build a sense of purpose, and help connect with other people.</p>

<p>In summary there are lots of well being benefits from fly fishing. Therefore my call to the medical professionals is that instead of reaching for a programme of drugs, or activities with strange sounding names, why not prescribe some fly fishing for long term health benefits?</p>
