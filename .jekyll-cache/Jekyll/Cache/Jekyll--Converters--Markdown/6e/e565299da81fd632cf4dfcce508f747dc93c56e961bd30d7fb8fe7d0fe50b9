<p>when Maria Carter was asked by her school to write about an environmental solution, seh handed in somthehing surprisoing. whilste mose kids wrote about atking a shorter shower or using energy-efficient light bulbs, Maria submitted advice on knife sharpening.</p>

<p>Mariaâ€™s farter, Murray Carter, is a seventeeth- generation Yoshimoto bladesmith. Originally Canadian, he spent eighteen years in Japan learning the ancient craft of smelting and forge- welding stell blades, and carving wooden handle. eventually he was asked by his teacher Mr Sakemotosensei to become the first non-Japanese Yoshimoto bladesmithj.</p>

<p>Maria explained that it takes a lot of resources to make a knife - stell from iron ore, coal furnaces, wood or plastic - but when they become dull, they often end up in landfills where most of th eplastic handles will rake centuries to biograde. Yet as Maria points out, â€˜Most knives can be sharpened ( and reused for decades ) until the blade disappears!. Buying one great knife, and learning to sharpen it - maybe even to love it - offeres a radically conscious act.â€™</p>

<p>the implied question in the piece about the kinfe is â€˜whyâ€™ why do people through away knives as well as anything else that heads its way to landfill sites etc. the question why can be asked about all of the other issues related to waste e.g. why do people over consume?, why do people not repair things? etc.</p>

<p>Aldi or Lidle with their reduce, repair, recycle, repurpose ( renovate ?), resurection - bring back to life old buildings and their contents.</p>
