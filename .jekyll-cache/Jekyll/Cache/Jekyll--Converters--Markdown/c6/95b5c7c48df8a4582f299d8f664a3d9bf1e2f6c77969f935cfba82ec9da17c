I"Â<p>After writing this blog for over five years I felt that it was a good time to look back and search out a few lessons for its future direction.</p>

<p><b>Original Aim Of the Blog</b></p>

<p>When I started the blog I had two aims: improve my writing skills and develop the discipline of publishing something on a regular basis. I am from a generation who missed out on the importance of grammar to express ideas clearly during my early education and I have struggled ever since. Because the title of the blog is - Thinking Out Aloud - which is describing the impact of ideas on how we live then it is important to describe those ideas clearly. Also, talking to many would-be-bloggers it was clear that after about three to four posts they run out of steam and stopped. I wanted to challenge myself to keep going. I was not targeting any particular audience which is at odds with the normal motivation of a blogger who is trying to establish the writer in the public consciousness either to promote themselves or a business that is related to them.</p>

<p>I had appreciated that there a thousands, if not many millions, of posts published every minute on the web therefore I decided to keep mine down to a two to three minute read in other words something that could be read while having a coffee. This meant that each post had to engage the reader quickly and make its point clearly - a great challenge! To give myself a change of maintaining the post frequency I kept them at one post per month. This give me enough time to explore ideas before putting pen to paper ( yes I draft ideas on paper! ).</p>

<p>I wasnâ€™t sure how the blog was going to go so I wanted to keep my running costs for the web site down to zero therefore I used the free <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> to run the web site and <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> with a <a href="https://jekyllthemes.io/free">free theme</a>. This approach allowed me to modify the software so that I could try out format ideas for the blog. <a href="https://analytics.google.com/">Google Analytics</a> gave me data on how often each post was being accessed and which search terms were picking up the posts.</p>

<p>So what have I learned? The biggest achievement is that I have kept the posts flowing for over five years which is against a background of trials and tribulations of life I can justifiably give myself a big tick.  The results on readership has been mixed. The most popular post had a business flavour, with the most popular so far is <a href="http://dtinblack.github.io/creative-solutions/">Being Creative With A Bear And Honey</a> Strangely, the posts relating the work of Wittgenstein to current issues were being picked up on a regular basis. Looking back over the five years worth of posts it is clear that I write in quite a formal way and therefore which is understandable because of my business background. This is something that needs to change for future posts. I also learnt that editing is an important part of the writing process. I can re-write an article several times until it has achieved what I want it to say.  Also, have an independent pair of eyes is a must ( big thanks to my Editor! ).</p>

<p>However, the biggest lesson was to focus on a more concrete theme and look at it from different angles. That theme will be the one that will increasingly dominate  our lives - climate crisis. For example, <a href="https://www.mheffernan.com/">Margaret Heffernan</a> in her book <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/Uncharted/Psr2DwAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=0">Uncharted</a> points out that we are addicted to prediction, desperate for certainty. But the complexity of modern life most experts in forecasting are reluctant to look more than 400 days out. What does this mean for the future targets set by governments and business that involve looking tens of years ahead? Another area is using Wittgenstein insights into how language works, as part of his solution to philosophical problems, and applying them to the sift through to separate facts about the climate crisis from what Greta Thunberg sucinctley puts <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/news/environment/greta-thunberg-we-ve-had-three-decades-of-blah-blah-blah-1.4468147">blah, blah, blah</a>.  I have already touched on in a the post <a href="http://dtinblack.github.io/careless-words-reduce-accountabilities/">Careless Words Reduce Accountability</a> but it is theme that I look forward to exploring further. The final area that I will try and address is how to improve the general publics understanding of science which has an impact on all of our lives. My interest is in mathematics. After many years of reading books, articles and blogs that have tried to explain mathematical concepts to a wider public I feel that the results have been mixed. Although science will be the key driver in combating the climate crisis, mathematics plays a role in how we organise ourselves to meet the challenge. This will not be easy.</p>

<p>To help steer the quality of the posts I have developed what I am calling the â€˜supermarket testâ€™.  Which is if given a few minutes of busy shoppers time can I explain the key ideas in a way that they understand and appreciate how it affects their life . But I also need to get more feedback from the web community therefore I will be devising ways to propmote each post to get it out their.</p>

<p>The last five years has been hard work and there have been many days when I have asked myself whay I am bothering. But after I have published each post there has been a feeling of achievement. I have learned lots about the art of communication using words but there is a lot more to learn.  I am looking froward to a few more years but with a clear focus on the climate crisis and a louder voice!</p>
