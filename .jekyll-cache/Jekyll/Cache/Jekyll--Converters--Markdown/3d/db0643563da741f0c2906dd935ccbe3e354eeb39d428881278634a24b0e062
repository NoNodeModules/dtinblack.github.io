Over the years of blogging I have learned many lessons. The following are the ones that I return to when my writing has lost its way.
</p>

<p><b>1. Why do you want to write a blog?</b></p>

<p>Large amount of time and energy go into into writing a blog and therefore it is important to be clear about the motivation behind the effort. Motivation can range from communicating the development of a business to establishing the author as a ‘thought leader’ about a particular subject.</p>

<p><b>2. Who is the target audience?</b></p>

<p>It is important to identify the target audience - the people who are going to regularly read the blog. There is nothing worse than spending hours producing a post that isn’t going to be read!</p>

<p><b>3. Why would the target audience want to read the blog?</b></p>

<p>What is the subject, or subjects, that the target audience are going to find interesting. How will the subject, or subjects, be used by the target audience, for example will it inform their business decisions?</p>

<p><b>4. How will the target audience find the blog?</b></p>

<p>Which communication channels will be used to promote the blog e.g. Twitter, recommendations by other bloggers, Search Engine Optimisation ( SEO ), targeting specific groups with tailored e-mails etc.</p>

<p><b>5. What frequency should the posts be published?</b></p>

<p>Everybody is busy and therefore how often will the target audience want to take a few minutes out to read the blog i.e once a week, once a month? Take into account the amount of time it will take to write a post and not churn them out too frequently so that the quality reduces - they need to remain fresh!</p>

<p><b>6. What format should the blogs take? </b></p>

<p>The format needs to make reading the blog as easy as possible, for example what will be the best mix of graphics and text? The type of blogs that I am interested in is of the written form. However, many bloggers use videos which will require a different set of skills.</p>

<p><b>7. What style should the blog have?</b></p>

<p>Will the blog be opinionated? - if so will it be balanced or take one side? Or will it be informative in which case if it is using technical terminology then the level of knowledge of the target audience will need to be taken into account. Also, what “voice” should the author take?</p>

<p><b>8. How many words should a typical post be?</b></p>

<p>Length of the blog is important because reading it has to fit into the busy lives of the target audience. Should it be short and too the point or be a long full of detailed analysis?</p>

<p><b>9. What will be the process required to develop the posts?</b></p>

<p><b>a. Gathering Ideas</b></p>

<p>There are any number of sources for gathering ideas for a post: newspapers, magazines, journals, radio, TV, tweets, conversations, blogs etc. Other sources are:  art exhibitions, museums, sport and theatre. The key point at this stage is to jot them down with a few lines about why they are interesting ( I use Google Documents on my smart phone but a pen and notebook is just as effective ).</p>

<p><b>b. Selecting An Idea To Develop</b></p>

<p>Set a deadline for each post which helps at the editing stage where time pressure can sharpen up a post. The following questions can be used to guide topic selection:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>What is the central message of the post ?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why is the message important ? Will it be useful, new, counterintuitive, or build on previous work ? If the message is exploring a new idea ( whether technological, social, business etc ) then what is it going to change ?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What credibility does the author have to support the views expressed in the message ? e.g. previous work, personal experience, academic or professional ?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>At this point draft a single sentence about what the post is about which will eventually be used as the summary. Also, start to think about an eye catching title that is relevant to the post.</p>

<p><b>c. The First Draft(s)</b></p>

<p>The purpose of the drafts at this stage is try and sharpen up the subject of the post. After several drafts it may not be clear but it is important to persevere. Sometimes it doesn’t become clear and then the idea goes back on the shelf until it has developed more.</p>

<p><b>d. <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/ks3/english/reading/character/revision/5/">Point of View</a></b></p>

<p>It is important to be clear what the relationship between the author and the reader - what is the perspective that the post is being written ?</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>First Person - you are writing about yourself and using words such as “I”, “me”,”my” and “mine”. But can also invovle “We”, “Us” and “Our”.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Second Person - you are addressing the reader directly and using “you”, “your” and “yours”.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Third Person - you are telling the reader and using words such as “he”, “she”,”it” and “they”.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><b>e. Editing</b></p>

<p>People can view editing as a ‘slash and burn’ process as their work is cut and changed. However, it as an important part in the creative process.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Grammar - is the thought being expressed in each sentence clearly expressed ? Are nouns, verbs etc. used correctly ? Are the aspects of time - past, present, and future - consistent ?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Paragraphs - are the paragraphs clearly linked ?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Title - is it eye catching enough for the reader to read further ?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Single sentence summary - does the single sentence that is displayed accurately cover the post ? Can the number of words be reduced further ?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tags - are the tags cover the key points in the post ?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Length - my posts are aimed at a quick read ( maybe over a coffee ? ) therefore the length needs to be somewhere around 500 - 700 words.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><b>10. How will feedback be gathered and used about the blog’s readership?</b></p>

<p>Apart from using Google Analytics to gather the frequency of readership ( which could be used to set targets ), adding comment capabilities to the blog allows direct feedback to be captured. Finally, how will regular communication the target audience be managed? - email subscriptions?</p>
