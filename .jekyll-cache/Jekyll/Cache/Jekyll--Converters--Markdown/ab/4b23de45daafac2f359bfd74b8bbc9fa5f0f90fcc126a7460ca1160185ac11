I"¢<p>In a previous <a href="http://dtinblack.github.io/biodiversity-in-crisis/">post</a> I made the mistake that I suspect many bloggers make which is not being clear about what I was discussing. Rereading the post I realised that the I was using a key word - biodiversity - in a way that was clouding the main point I was making.</p>

<p>In the post my I was worried that in their charge for a zero-carbon world governments would trample over biodiversity.  My concern was based on the way that many governments, as well as businesses and other institutions, were including biodiversity at a superficial level in their policies. The point that I was making was that we need both: a zero carbon world ( or better still a negative carbon world ) <i>and</i> an increase in biodiversity. However, I had fallen into the same trap and was using the word biodiversity as a brand name rather than a call to action.</p>

<p>I am not the only one struggling with the meaning of biodiversity. A search on the web came back with over 93 Million hits where it had some form of definition.  The one that gets closest to my thinking comes from the <a href="https://www.cbd.int/convention/guide/">Convention on Biological Diversity</a>: ‚ÄúBiological diversity - or biodiversity - is the term given to the variety of life on Earth and the natural patterns it forms. The biodiversity we see today is the fruit of billions of years of evolution, shaped by natural processes and, increasingly, by the influence of humans. It forms the web of life of which we are an integral part and upon which we so fully depend.‚Äù Another term that adds to confusion is <a href="https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/food-web-concept-and-applications-84077181/">food web</a>, which used to be called the food chain,  which represents feeding relationships within a community. More words can be thrown into the mix to add confusion such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem">ecosystem</a> which is used to describe all the living things in an area and the way they affect each other and the environment. There are many more words that are used where their meanings overlap in discussions about the environment which creates a confusing picture.</p>

<p>What the previous post was pointing out is that there is a complex relationship between each species and if we are not careful when we change the way that we live we could have a devastating impact on some of species we are trying to save! The example of the hedgehog highlights the sensitivity we have on a species. The reasons underlying hedgehogs‚Äô precipitous <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/earth/story/20150818-living-with-hedgehog">decline are varied and complex</a>. In the UK the hedgehog‚Äôs main predators in the UK are <a href="https://www.hedgehogstreet.org/predators/">badgers</a>. The UK Governments <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/culling-badgers-bovine-tuberculolsis-tb-cull-defra-a9147766.html">badger culling</a> programme is an attempt to reduce <a href="https://www.daera-ni.gov.uk/articles/what-bovine-tuberculosis">TB in cattle</a> but it has driven those that have survived to move into more land each month. As they cover a new area they will probably eat more hedgehogs and therefore reducing the population. Coming closer to our gardens <a href="https://www.hedgehogstreet.org/about-hedgehogs/diet/">hedgehogs eat</a> worms, beetles, slugs, caterpillars, earwigs and millipedes.  But the use of <a href="https://www.britishhedgehogs.org.uk/helping-hedgehog/">slug pellets</a> not only can poison them but reduces their food supply. This is a clear example where we have failed to understand the complexity of our relationship with another species with a devastating impact.</p>

<p>Governments, businesses other organisations must use the word biodiversity clearly so that they can be held accountable for their actions. Using words that hang in the air allows them too much scope to argue away their failed actions. In the case of the UK Government‚Äôs Public Services Social Value Act (2012) which has increased focus on social value across all public sector procurement. The recently updated <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/procurement-policy-note-0620-taking-account-of-social-value-in-the-award-of-central-government-contracts">Social Value Legislation</a> states that all government contracts above a certain value must demonstrate that they have improved social value. In amongst the documents there is a framework that includes Climate Change with only one mention of biodiversity which is measured by an increase in green spaces. There is no link to how increasing green spaces, although a good thing,  will improve any particular species. If green spaces are increased but the hedgehog continues to decline can that be considered a success?</p>

<p>Being clear on the meaning of words used by organisations is key to holding them accountable for their actions. Although there are many good intentions in the various policies and statements produced by governments, businesses and other organisations, they must have clear actions whose results that can be measured. In the case of biodiversity the complex relationship between all species must be made clear so that our actions only improve the situation of other species. The environment that all species, including us, rely on is chocking from greenhouse gases but let us make sure that as we clear up the mess we don‚Äôt end up the last species on the planet!</p>
