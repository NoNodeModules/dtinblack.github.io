I"k<p><b>Opening Sentences</b></p>

<p>If I had £5 for every time a celebrity or TV personality declared with pride that they “couldn’t do maths, and never understood it!” then I would no longer have to worry about money. And yet they “do maths” probably every day of there lives.</p>

<p><b>Basics of Mathematics - and where it goes wrong</b></p>

<p>Mathematics boils down to three key activities: counting, measuring and calculating. We all count whether it how many rolls of toilet paper that we have bought, and we measure out ingredients every time we back or cook. And we are always calculting: how many minutes before a meeting ends, how many rolols of toilet paper do we need for the rest of the month, or how many days before our next hoilday. No celevrities “do maths” like everybody else. The problem starts to get more complicated when abstraction enters the equation - the dreaded \(x\) and \(y\) hotley followed by the other words that spreads fear “algebra!” Then most people switch off and it uis usually at school. Those who carry on use the higher levels of mathematics for the next stage of their career such as going into banking, engineering or science. Newer application of algebra - Analysing apps for example how much customers</p>

<p>But any form of analysis requires some form of mathematics <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/topics/z9yb4wx/articles/zkf7xfr">BBC Bitesize - Algebra and its uses</a></p>

<p>It is not counting, measuring or calculation, although those are skills, but what is achieved by thses skills. Counting etc, is a feature but there are many benefits for example peace of mind in finances, etc.</p>

<p>Emphasis needs to move away from mathematics as a bundle of techniques to the benefits of applying those techniques to situations in our lives. Just as english is not about grammar, although important, but the ability to express ourselves in a wide variety of situations ranging from filling out forms ro writing poetry.</p>

<p><b>Why is maths such a challenge?</b></p>

<p>Mathematics is has a poor image within society and anybody that declares that they use or even enjoy mathematics are seen as either a boffin or somebody to sits behind a computer wearing some outrages the shirts. There is also the attitude that ‘others do maths’ and it is seen as a service such as cleaning or delivering parcels.</p>

<p>It would be much better if we all “did maths” to some level then we may be in better control of our lives!</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cultural - poor image - very little use of what has been learned</li>
  <li>Abstraction</li>
  <li>Poor education - early days of learning and applying formula and then the big blow - abstraction!</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>need to explore why people struggle with ‘abstraction’ not just with mathematics but other areas such as art end possibly generalisations ( which could be considered another form of abstraction ) - probaly needs just a few sentences but it is an important point e.g. ‘x’ and other mathematical terminology</li>

<p><b>Notes:</b></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a10A5PneXlo">Bertrand Russell - Interview (“Face to Face”, 1959)</a> - about 11 minutes in when asked what it was about mathematics that he liked he replied “I liked it for a number of reasons. The sheer please that people get from music or poetry, it delighted me. Then apart from that I thought that mathematics was the key to understanding the universe and I found that all sorts of everyday things explained by mathematics “</p>
