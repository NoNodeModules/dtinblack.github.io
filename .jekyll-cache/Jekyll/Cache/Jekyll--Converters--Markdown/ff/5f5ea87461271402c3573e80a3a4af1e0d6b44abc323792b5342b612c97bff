"We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them" - Albert Einstein

</div>

<p>The aim of this blog is to write about solutions to problems. The solutions that will be discussed are arrived at by taking different perspectives on the problems.</p>

<p>where the solution is arrived at by taking a different perspective. The approach is based on Wittgenstein’s <a href="https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Aspect_seeing">Aspect Seeing</a> which is demonstrated in his discussion about the Duck-Rabbit picture. ( or as wittgenstein would say using Aspect Seeing e.g. the dog / rabbit picture ).</p>

<p>There are many examples of Aspect Seeing for example in mathematics where when faced by a problem reformulating it into a different problem can provide a solution ( or in the extreme case of Category Theory ). Changes in perspective is currently being explianed by different ways of seeing e.g. Neuropsychology ( where new connections are mad ein the brain  ). But my approach will be withingthe context of Language-games. In other words how does the meaning of a word(s)  create the problem and therefore a change in their meaning could open up new solutions.</p>

<p>How can this be done?</p>

<p>Technicques such as ‘what-if’ for example what if the Google took over the NHS how would they run it differently? Rmember Dickens and ‘as-if’ to use metaphors etc.</p>

<p>Skills required - generalist - lost of different interests but not an expert in anything particularly therefore how can this be brought to the aims of the blog. Also need to find a style / voice that is engaging to a wide a readership as possible.</p>

    <p>Blank Page Problem - happens because of overthinking about what the reader would like to read ( this includes the level of controversy ). Therefore must write first then edit for the reader.  { this could be put in the tips for writing }</p>
