I"ë<p>The subject of risk has hit the media in connection with the side effects of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca">Oxford-AstraZenica vaccine</a>. But the benefits of the vaccine are being drowned out by the general chatter about the risk of <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n774">blood clots</a>. Risk makes good headlines but are we missing out when the benefits are not included in the discussion?</p>
