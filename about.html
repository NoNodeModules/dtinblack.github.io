<p> The aim of the blog is to explain subjects that I find interesting as clearly as possible.  
<br></p>

<p>This blog uses the <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/analytics/">Google Analytics</a> service to better 
understand how people are accessing the site. This information is collected in an 
anonymous form and includes the number of visitors to the site.<br></p>

<p>The software used by the blog will continue to change as I learn more about layouts
and different approaches to navigation therefore don't be surprised if it look keeps changing.<br></p>
