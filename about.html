<p>The aim of the posts are to explore ideas and their potential application.
<br></p>
 
<p> The style of the posts will vary depending on how the ideas are being explored. For example they could be a 
story from the future, or a series of emails, or whatever format feels relevant. The length of the posts will be short and 
aimed at thought provoking rather than a detailed description.<br></p>

<p>Although the name of the blog site has computing technology connotations the ideas explored will cover 
a wide range of subjects.</p>

<p>This site uses the <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/analytics/">Google Analytics</a> service to better understand how people are accessing the site. This information is collected in an 
anonymous form and includes the number of visitors to the site.<br></p>

<p>The site will continue to change as I learn more about developing the underlying software and picking up 
on techniques developed by others.<br></p>
