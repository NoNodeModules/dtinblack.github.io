title: About

<p> The blog follows my steps in learning about and applying Wittgensteins insights, a form of 
conceptual clarification, to Neuroscience. For example, a typical problem will be getting conceptual 
clarity on the Grandmother Cell ( which has echoes of William James' Pontifical Cell). Another area is 
comparing the predictive capability of Neuroscience to Physics.<br></p>

<p> Neuroscience great promise for any illness affecting the nervous system, and in particular the brain, 
and therefore cures for the different forms of Dementia, Parkinsons, Autism etc. <br></p>

<p> The style of this blog is inspired by Richard Feynman's 19xx Nobel Lecture where rather than 
discussion the result of his work on Quantum Electrodynamics, he described the process behind the research 
and included full of faults etc. My blog is much much less ambitious. <br></p>
