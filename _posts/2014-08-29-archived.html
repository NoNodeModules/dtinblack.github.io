<p>
In an a Financial Times Obituary ( 8/9 March 2014 )  
<a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/11d18136-a49a-11e3-b915-00144feab7de.html#axzz3BZZo4oXo" target="_blank">Ralph Bahna</a>,
credited with many innovations in the 
travel and leisure industry, was quoted during an interview with the industry magazine Tour & Travel: &#34;I 
just don&#39;t come in and say &#34;ah-hah&#34; ! The answer relates to clearly defining what the problem is, 
forcing yourself to write it down, 
researching the alternatives, picking one that will ring the bell and then going 
out and selling it&#34;.  
</p> 

<p>
What is interesting about the advice is that when a problem is written down then it can be analysed so that 
fuzzy concepts, wild ideas and general waffle can be removed. For example, the National Health Serivce ( NHS )
in the UK are criticized 
about the speed of innovation. This is a complex problem and there maybe many underlying factors but one 
attempt at writing out the problem could be:&#39;The <a href="http://m.hsj.co.uk/5073370.article" target="_blank">
NHS is slow at innovation because it</a> 
doesn&#39t have enough money&#39;.  The first thing to observe about the statement is that it identifies a problem: 
&#39;The NHS is slow at innovation&#39; and a solution: &#39;it doesn&#39;t have enough money&#39;.  
Digging deeper there are three concepts that are at best unclear: &#39;slow&#39;, &#39;innovation&#39; and 
&#39;enough&#39;. 
Starting with &#39;slow&#39; it is unclear - is it perception or are there some hard facts ( a quick web 
search produces no hard facts about the speed of innovation in the NHS). Next &#39;innovation&#39;, another 
search on the web and many definitions of innovation and scope for many experts and management consultant 
fees. Finally &#39;enough&#39; - how much is &#39;enough&#39; ?  What about  &#39;innovation&#39; - after 
more searching the only conclusion is that that there is no clear definition.  Therefore the stated problem, 
and solution, is loaded with confusion and can only lead to a wasting time and money.
Another factor when looking at the problem description is the context that the solution will eventually 
be applied. For in this case the NHS, Government, patents etc.  The context is important because 
the solution needs to be sold and therefore by defining the group that is struggling with the problem will 
be the target for the sales campaign.  
</p>

<p>
Of course the NHS example is for illustration purposes.  However, taking another example how about 
&#34;One of the highest priorities for the 
<a href="http://www.nhs.uk/news/2013/02February/Pages/Latest-obesity-stats-for-England-are-alarming-reading.aspx" target="_blank">
NHS is the reduction of obesity which is estimated to cost &#163;6bn</a> per 
year&#34;. The description of the problem is clearly defined and quantified. However, it could be criticised for 
being at too high level. However, it can be broken down into factors for example: education, economic, social 
context etc. that could be quantified, and then solutions explored. Writing out the problem weeds out 
vague words, identifies concepts that can be quantified, and through analysis of its context who is going 
to buy the solution.
</p>

<p>
Ralph Bahna was always looking for competitive advantage, which had to be &#34;neither short-term nor 
flimsily opportunistic&#34;. Writing down the problem avoids this problem, and from a solid description of 
the problem then successful innovation will follow.
