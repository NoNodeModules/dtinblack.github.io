<p>
There is always and awkward moment when meeting people for the first time and the conversation 
turns to “What do you do ?”.  I am thrown into a dilemma: do I include in my reply that I am an Engineer, 
or worse a Systems Engineer! When I blurt out something about being an Engineer their reply is along the 
lines of  “Good we need lots of Engineers to get us out of this recession” and then they quickly move 
onto the price of houses or the weather.
</p>

<p>
However, the situation is changing. In a recent Harvard Business Review about the 
<a href="https://hbr.org/2014/11/the-best-performing-ceos-in-the-world" target="_blank">
Best-Performing CEO’s in the World </a>
an interesting result emerged: 24 out of the top 100 CEOs are Engineers.  
The results also show that Engineers can head up non-technical companies. Not bad for a profession 
that has a public perception of repairing things!
</p>

<p>
So what are the qualities and skills that an Engineer can bring to business leadership ?
</p>

<p>
An Engineer, by the very nature of their profession, takes a practical approach to problem solving.  
They break down complex problems into their component parts and then rebuild a new solution. They are 
restless in improving the performance of whatever they are working on whether it is making a car faster, 
safer or more fuel efficient. This urge to improve can best be sumarised by one of my old lecturers who 
observed: “ if you want to maintain the status quo – don’t get an Engineer involved. The first thing 
they will do is take it apart to understand how it works then put it back together in a way that makes 
it better” How many businesses can afford to maintain the status quo ? 
</p>

<p>
Change is at the heart of any business, whether it is driven by competition, technology or legislation.  
An Engineer can apply their capability in taking a systems view to a business, and with their analytical 
skill, they can make decisions about one part of an organization that will improve a businesses  overall 
performance. Also, they instinctively take into account the risks and include safety margins to ensure 
successes. However communication is key in any change in a business and because an Engineer usually 
worked their way to the top and therefore they understand the intricate workings of a business and can 
communicate effectively to different levels. All this adds up to successfully managing change.
</p>

<p>
Finally engineers can be both detailed and yet take a broader view of the environment that the business 
is working in. History is held together by many examples: Isambard Kingdom Brunel who changed the 
shape of a countries transportation system which increased its wealth, Henry Ford introduced techniques 
of  mass production that are still followed today, and Jeff Bezos has  revolutionised how we shop with 
Amazon.
</p>

<p>
I am now looking forward to meeting new people and when the awkward point in the discussion comes I 
will confidently add to my reply  “ … and one of the fastest growing professions in business 
leadership!"
