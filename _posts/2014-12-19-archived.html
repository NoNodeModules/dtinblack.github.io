title: Listening Between The Notes 
description: Listening to sound with Stockhausen.
---

<p>
For a long time I didn’t understand 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karlheinz_Stockhausen" target="_blank">Stockhausen.</a>
His music was full of squeaks, trickles, crunches and 
sometimes long periods of silence. Every year I would sit down and listen very hard, but after five 
minutes I would give up and listen to something else. For somebody who grew up on Jimi Hendrix, The Who 
and Led Zeppelin it was a million miles from a driving beat or soaring lead guitar. I was aware of 
classic music but my taste fell under the category of ‘popular classic’. However, a few years ago I sat 
down for my yearly attempt to understand Stockhausen. After a few minutes I decided to turn the volume 
up; a door into his music creaked open. For me, Stockhausen is exploring the colour of sound. There is 
more to music than the rhythm, harmony and melody. Stockhausen was exploring the richness of sound that 
we would normally dismiss as ‘noise’. By concentrating on the sound between the notes, I could hear a 
deeper source of its energy and emotion.

From then on my music collection took on a different significance. I started to appreciate a wider 
range of classic music and in particular piano music. I suddenly found the joy in the piano playing 
of the <a href="http://www.toniandrosithefilm.com/" target="_blank">Grunshlag Sisters,</a>
and <a href="http://www.earbox.com/" target="_blank">John Adams</a>
music opened up new dimensions., and my old favourites such as 
Beethoven took on a new freshness.  However, returning to my early influences rock music my new 
appreciation of sound changed the way that I heard the playing of the musicians that are hidden in 
the background: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bonham" target="_blank">John Bonham</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Moon" target="_blank">Keith Moon</a>, and 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Entwistle" target="_blank">John Entwistle</a> 
brought richness to the music of their bands. 
Also, listening to the wider sound in music has confirmed the iconic status of albums such as 
Captain Beafheart’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trout_Mask_Replica" target="_blank">Trout Mask Replica</a>!.

Many unusual sources have found their way onto my listening list, for example the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJQ17v0v4ug" target="_blank">Navajo Indians Night Chant</a>
that is both haunting and sounds spiritual. But the sound between the notes is the big message, which I 
continue to take from Stockhausen’s music. This approach can be applied  to areas outside of music:  
walking through a city of the countryside opens up new sounds; no longer does bird song fill the 
countryside but the wind rattling through the leaves and the cattle rasping the grass is enlightening. Even 
the distance noise of traffic with a police siren-bleeping cutting through the cacophony brings richness 
to the experience. Also, new ‘artists’ have been added to my list for example 
<a href="http://www.chriswatson.net/" target="_blank">Chris Watson</a>
who captures everyday sounds 
in a way that exposes its richness. And the resonance of the human voice takes on a greater quality and 
can be heard in programs such as 
<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006x2tq" target="_blank">BBC Radio 3 Between The Ears</a>
and
<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01cqx3b/broadcasts/upcoming" target="_blank">BBC Radio 4 The Listening Project</a>

Wittgenstein wrote that "people nowadays think that scientists exist to instruct 
them, poets, musicians, etc to give them pleasure. The idea <i>that these have something to teach them</i> – 
that does not occur to them". My education started when I turned up the music and listened to the sound in 
between the notes.
