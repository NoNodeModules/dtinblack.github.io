title: Next Big Web Challenge ? 
description: Developing the Web for education.

<p>
The Web, as the name suggests, has spread into most aspects of life: connecting people, changing how we shop, 
impacting on business and health information, and in the future with the &#34Internet-of-Things&#34 
machines connecting to machine which will manage our environment. In amongst all of this &#34connectedness&#34 
is an aspect of growing importance: education. There are many examples ranging from finding out about 
subjects through sites such as Wikipedia and other sources to the growth of Massive Open Online Courses 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course" target="_blank">( MOOCs )</a>
 which has opened up education to as many people as it can around the world. However, 
 there is one area that needs to be improved: access to relevant information based on a persons level of 
 education.

<p>
Let me give you an example. Recently a breakthrough was announced 

<a href="http://www.nhs.uk/news/2014/07July/Pages/Blood-test-for-Alzheimers-no-better-than-coin-toss.aspx" 
target="_blank">announced</a>

in fight against the 
terrible disease Alzheimer&#39s. This news that a simple test had been developed that could predict the onset of 
the disease and therefore could speed up the development of drugs to combat the disease. I was curious about 
the science behind the breakthrough, in particular the analysis of the data to support the claim. 
Starting with Google ( other search engines could be used ) I quickly found a copy of the   

<a href="http://www.alzheimersanddementia.com/article/S1552-5260(14)02454-6/abstract" target="_blank">
paper.</a>


Of course 
the paper was full of terminology that I didn&#39t understand. However, more searches helped to clarify the 
different proteins, scanning techniques, assessment of Alzheimer&#39s etc. that give me an overview of the 
research. However, I was still interested in a deeper understanding of the statistical analysis which was 
used to develop the claim is that the test is 87% accurate. This is when the problems started. When searching 
about information on techniques used by a subject you start searching through a mish-mash of information 
that various from: poor quality  videos, badly written overheads for a lecture, chapters from draft books, 
chapters from books no longer available, lecture notes, different notation etc.  I like to work out how 
something works, in this case the analysis of the data, from first principles which gives me a better 
understanding of the technique rather than &#34applying a formula&#34.  After many coffee drenched hours 
I eventually found the correct level of information which was absolutely fascinating.

<p>
This is the challenge to the search engine companies - when searching on a particular subject I need the 
information that is returned to be at a level that I can understand. Or if not quite at my level, then I am 
prepared to but in a bit of work, after all that is part of the learning process. What is at the back of my 
mind with this challenge is that search engines happily display adverts, suggest books or other products 
that I may be interested in buying. Why can&#39t that be done for a new subject that I find interesting ? 
So search engine companies - sharpen up your algorithms, speed up the computers and lets see what you can 
really do.
