Jo took a deep breath and then pressed the key.  The “sending email” message wrestled with 
doubt. Cash flow was poor and costs had to be cut. She was clear that after over 
twenty years of building up the Best Bean coffee shop chain, she wasn’t going to give it up 
without a fight!

<p>
Lisa loved coffee.  Better still was meeting up with her friends at their local coffee shop 
after dropping off the children at school. Today was different.  Her local coffee shop was 
closed for some much needed renovation.  However Lisa was undeterred and found Best Bean on 
the web and, although further in town, they all agreed to meet there. But the first sip was 
disastrous.  It was too hot!  Not enough coffee and milk, which was a clear sign of cost 
cutting and they felt, cheated. Lisa tweeted later that night: ‘# worst coffee ever !!! @BestBean 
don’t waste your money !’.

The distance between Jo’s action and the consequences is called the moral distance. 
I first came across the term moral distance in an article written by Philip Delves 
Broughton in the Financial Times ( 1 June 2015 ) where it is defined as “ … the moral 
distance, which separates companies from their customers and senior managers and shareholders 
from their employees. Moral distance means that the organisations and those who lead them never 
have to suffer the moral consequences of their actions”.

Business leaders face a dilemma. As their business grows they have less and less time on the 
front line; therefore there is potential for the moral distance to grow. Can it be reduced for 
a large business ?  Here are some thoughts:
</p>

<ul>
<p><li type="circle">
Staff should be involved in any changes to the business. In Jo’s case if she had asked the staff 
for ideas about managing costs then better options may have come forward. In my experience all 
front line staff are dedicated to their businesses. Their values are aligned with those of the 
business and they know what is best for their customers. 
</li></p>

<p><li type="circle">
A community of customers could be developed using social media and then be involved in any future changes to 
the business. Also, their input to any decisions would check the moral impact of any actions and therefore 
make them feel part of the business.
</li></p>


<p><li type="circle">
Business leaders should be visible and approachable.  They should reflect and align their 
own values with those of the business and its customers. This would give customers the confidence 
that the business was morally sound in its actions.
</li></p>
</ul>

<p>
Moral distance is a concept that allows business leaders to think about the consequences of their 
actions.  In particular thinking more about their actions on their customers.  Jo was under pressure 
to take quick action but by taking more time to assess the consequences of her actions might have 
resulted in new customers.
