title: Living With Probabilities 
description: Probabilities use in many aspects of life.

<p>
Probabilities crop up in the news, documentaries, blogs and cover a wide range of activities:  
will it rain today ?, the chances of developing a disease,  or whether to place a bet.  
They seem to cover most aspects of life.  But what is a probability?
</p> 

<p>
When we flip the coin into the air to help decided whether to stay in and watch TV or go out 
for a meal, then as it twists and turns there is no way to predict which way it will land. The 
decision has been left to a random outcome. It could land heads, or tails.  To quantify the 
uncertainty we calculate a probability.  To do this we need to know the possible outcomes, in 
this case it is 2, e.g. heads or tails. Therefore the probability of landing heads is 1 of 2 
possible events which gives “1 in 2 chance of heads”  ( in percentages 50% or in gambling 
terminology “evens” ).  All probabilities follow the same principles but the calculations 
can be different.

In the case of predicting the weather it can’t be flipped up in the air like a coin ! Instead, 
the 
<a href="http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/news/in-depth/science-behind-probability-of-precipitation" target="_blank">Meteorological Office</a>
uses mathematical models. The models describe the relationship 
between a very large number of variables for example temperature, pressure, wind speed and 
direction across the country. Combining the models with measurements from weather stations 
they calculate different weather outcomes, which results in probability of rain in a region. 
Chances of rain are watched eagerly by farmers about to harvest their crops, events organisers 
about to order umbrellas, and filters into conversations around coffee machines.

To plan the amount of resources required for patients, health organisations use medical records 
to calculate probabilities of developing a disease. In the case of cancer, medical records show 
how many people have developed one of the many different forms during a lifetime. The data is 
gathered together to produce a series of probabilities, for example in the UK population there 
is  
<a href="http://www.macmillan.org.uk/Cancerinformation/Aboutcancer/Whogetscancer.aspx" target="_blank"> a 1 in 3 chance of developing cancer</a>
at some point in their lifetime.

Gambling is big business and covers many activities. For example at the beginning of the football 
season all teams have an equal chance of coming top of a league table. However, some teams have a 
stronger squad of players, or new managers bring different ideas to improve performance and so on.  
The many factors can affect the likelihood of the team wining the league.  Gamblers assess the 
factors and place a bet on the  
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds" target="_blank">odds</a>
of a team winning, for example the odds maybe “6 to 1” ( in 
gambling odds of 6 to 1 mean that there is 6 possible outcomes that an event will not occur and 1 
that it will therefore the equivalent probability is "1 chance in 7" or 14% of winning).
</p> 

<p>
Probabilities allow the quantification of the level of uncertainty that an event will occur. They can 
be used to plan for rainy days, help those who are going to develop diseases, and possibly, just possibly, 
avoid losing money !
