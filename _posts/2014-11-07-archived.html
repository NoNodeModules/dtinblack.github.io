“for the invention of a mathematical foundation for natural philosophy which led to the 
discovery of a universal force, gravity, which applies to all objects in all parts of the 
universe.”
</i></p>

<p>
This year’s Noble Laureate is rewarded for answering the question: how does a force make a body it move ? 
This fundamental question covers every object in the Universe from cups in a house to the planets in the sky. 
Newton’s breakthrough was to develop a new mathematical approach, 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus" target="_blank">the calculus</a> that he used to reason 
about the forces on a body and its subsequent motion.
</p>

<p>
In his work Newton developed three laws of motion. The first states that a body will stay at rest, or 
remain in uniform motion in a straight line, unless a force acts it upon: a cannonball resting on the 
ground will remain stationary, however as it flies through the air both the forces of air resistance and 
gravity will bring it back to the earth. Newton also reasoned that the force applied to the object is 
equal to its mass times its acceleration, which is his second law of motion. For example, the force provided 
by the exploding gunpowder accelerates the cannonball through the air. The greater the acceleration and 
heavier the cannonball then the greater the damage it causes. Finally, when a cannon is fired, the cannon 
will be pushed backwards a yard or two. This action and reaction is described by Newton’s third law, which 
states that every action has an equal, and opposite reaction. 
</p>

<p>
Newton’s work cumulated in an answer to the question of why objects fall to the earth. Using the insights on 
the motion of bodies he identified a new force called gravity. He showed that gravity is an attractive force 
between bodies. The earth, which is a very massive body, will exert a force on an apple, a relatively tiny 
body, as it hangs on a tree. The gravitational force is pulling the apple to the earth and the earth is 
being pulled towards apple ! Newton then reasoned that the same force is acting like a web on the planets, 
which stopped them from crashing into the earth. He went on to develop a mathematical relationship for the 
gravitational force that involved the mass of the bodies and their distance apart from each other. Newton 
took this result and solved many outstanding problems, for example the deflection of the planet’s orbit 
around the sun by the pull of the sun's gravity, and the gravitational pull of the moon and sun to explain 
the ocean tides.

The Noble Committee agreed that the intellectual break through, and subsequent discoveries, made by Sir Issac Newton 
would benefit mankind for many years into the future.
