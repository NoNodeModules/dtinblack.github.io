title: Day Dreaming About Systems
description: Generating and testing ideas for new processes.

<p>
Sometimes it is good to sit back; stare out of the window, and day dream.
It is a time to let ideas flow in a way that they can be played with and explored.
</p>

<p>
This happened recently when I was thinking about a recent experience >I had in
Accident and Emergency ( A&E ). What caught my attention was the amount of
note taking that was taking place. Page after page was filled out with my
details and my symptoms. A few weeks later I was discussing what I saw
with an A&E Manager and during our conversation I took a guess at the number
of pages: maybe three maybe four. The manager corrected me that there was
probably ten ! Inquiring further about how the information gets from paper
into their computer systems he replied that when the clinicians find a few
minutes they type the information in. This was the starting point of my day dream.
What would an A&E where all of the of the information gathered about a patient was
automatically captured immediately into the computer systems ? No note taking
and then typing the information into a computer system. What would such a system look
like ? What system could be built ? What technology would be needed ? How would
it be used ?
</p>

<p>
In amongst my day dreaming I remembered reading an article
<a href="https://engineering.stanford.edu/news/smartphone-speech-recognition-faster-and-more-accurate-typing" target="_blank">Smartphone speech recognition is faster and more accurate than typing</a>
- could this be adapted to catch the conversation between the clinician and
the patient ? Could their discussion would then be translated into the appropriate
medical information and stored and automatically stored in a data base ?
What Artificial Intelligence could be used ? Would the clinicians use head sets ?
How about walls that listen rather than using head sets ? Could techniques such
as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_signal_separation" target="_blank">Blind Source Seperation</a> that
can take the sound of an orchestra and work back to the sound an individual musician is making.
Could that be done for people speaking in a room ( how could be privacy be managed ? )
</p>

<p>
At some point in a day dreaming session the ideas need to be tested against reality.
To do this I try and develop a set of criteria that will guide my thoughts to
a practical solution. In the case of A&E I developed the following criteria:

<ul>
  <li>Accuracy - the system needs to translate the discussion between the
    clinician and the patient without any error - 100% accurate ?</li>
  <li>Contact Time - the system should increase the amount of contact
  time between the clinicians and the patient. In other words, the level of
  bureaucracy should be reduced ( which in this case is the time for transcribing
  written notes into a computer system )</li>
  <li>Invisible - the system should not interfere with the interaction between
  the clinician and the patient ( it should not be intrusive - no switching buttons,
  tapping on tablets etc)</li>
</ul>

</p>

<p>
Wrapped around these three criteria is money of which there are two aspects: buying
and installing the system, and the cost of operating it. Will it be cheaper
than the current operation ? Can parts form existing technology be adapted and
used and therefore costs ( and risks ) be reduced ? 
</p>

<p>
The phone rings and I return to the real world. A project needs to be completed.
I have to park my day dreaming exercise, until I can get a few more minutes to
play with the idea.
