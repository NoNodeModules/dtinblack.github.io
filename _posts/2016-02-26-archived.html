title: Beyond The Limits of On-line Learning
description: Thoughts about the future of on-line learning.
---

<p>
Developments in web technology has opened up access to education beyond the classroom, for example Massive 
Online Open Access ( 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course" target="_blank">MOOC</a>
).  MOOCs are available to people 
around the world at any time of the day, or night, and cover a wide range of subjects. However, 
will the web ever be able to deliver the ideal learning situation: one-to-one ?
</p>

<p>
Based on the MOOCs I have undertaken the quality of the teaching is very varied. Competence 
assessment is conducted by quizzes, or submitting material for assessment, at the end of each section of the 
course. Access to the expert is limited to their comments on forums where participants are 
encouraged to discuss what they have learned or problems that they have experienced. The delivery 
costs are low and I suspect that the course development costs are minimal because they appear to 
be using course material that would have been delivered traditionally ( for those developing MOOCs 
can I suggest Derek Rowntree’s excellent book 
<a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bTE4nQEACAAJ&dq=Teaching+Through+Self-Instruction&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y" target="_blank">Teaching Through Self-Instruction: How to Develop Open Learning Materials</a>
for the design of distance learning material ).  Also, there is no alignment 
or assessment of participants competence about a subject before starting a course or their ability 
in ‘learning how to learn’ which is important for on-line learning.
</p>

<p>
Here are some thoughts about improving on-line learning:
</p>

<p>
1 )  On-line learning is limited to subjects that rely heavily on text, video and graphics. 
However there are many subjects where learning is achieved by doing fro example many of the craft 
and trades. Could a system be developed to monitor and advise on learning-by-doing ? 
Lets take an example: hammering a nail into a piece of wood. A web based system could monitor 
( something like 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinect" target="_blank">Kinect</a>
? ) the swing of the hammer, the point where the nail was struck etc. 
and then offer advice on how to improve the hammering technique. This is a simple example to 
highlight the principles however it could be extended to other learning-by-doing activities. 
</p>

<p>
2 ) We often learn more about a subject through making mistakes than correctly answering questions about it. 
One of the problems with the current 
on-line learning systems is that the learner gets no feedback on where they have gone wrong if they 
incorrectly answer a question. If a system could gather the steps that the learner made in 
arriving at an answer then it could work out where they had gone wrong and provide advice 
( could development of 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-learning" target="_blank">Q-Learning</a>
type algorithm be used ?)
</p>

<p>
3 ) The Web is full of information that includes lecture notes, Wikipedia, blogs etc. However 
the material implicitly assumes a level of competency about the reader. A system that logged 
the readers level of competency on subjects could  match the search results to their competency 
( some form of competence assessment similar to that used by 
<a href="https://www.knewton.com/" target="_blank">Knewton</a> and integrated with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web" target="_blank">Semantic Web</a>
technology ? ).
</p>

<p>
One-to-one learning is an ideal situation but currently cost prohibitive. Can further development 
of web based technology open up learning beyond the classroom and achieve one-to-one learning ?
