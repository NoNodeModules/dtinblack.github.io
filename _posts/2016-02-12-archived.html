title: What A Difference A Medical Device Can Make  
description: My experience of a medical device.

<p>
John Lennon famously said, “Life is what happens while you are busy making other plans”. And so 
it did. I had planned a week of developing ideas, gathering data for a project, business 
meetings and so. Then life struck. With a bladder that felt like the size of a football 
I was rushed to the local Medical Centre where a urinary catheter was inserted to my great 
relief! Everything was put on hold. However, as an engineer with an interest in equipment 
that help people manage or recover from an illness the situation was one I had explore further
during my recuperation.

The purpose of a 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_device" target="_blank">medical device</a>
is to "diagnose, prevent, or treat a disease or other conditions, and does not achieve its purposes through 
chemical action within or on the body." They can 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_device" target="_blank">range</a>
from disposable gloves through to

The market for medical devices is projected to be a market worth

globally by 2017. The urinary catheter market is estimated to be worth

by 2020. Big business !
</p>

<p>
The urinary catheter has been around for
<a href="http://orca.cf.ac.uk/77060/1/03091902.2015.1085600.pdf" target="_blank">3500 years.</a>
The earliest ones consisted of 
bronze tubes, reeds, straws and curled-up palm leaves ( ouch ! ). The device has evolved 
throughout the centuries to the one that I am using with all of its parts made from soft plastic. 
There must be many design challenges and off the top of my head they would include: minmise infection, 
no leakage, minimal pain during installation and extraction, ease of use. The actual list I am sure 
will be significantly longer.
</p>

<p>
It is interesting how the world changes for the user of a medical device.   
In my case, public toilets were key points of reference when out shopping.  
I developed a mental map of where and when the toilets 
were open.  Of course planning is critical to cover all eventualities when out and about
especially when drinking too much ! 
</p>

<p>
Using the catheter requires some basic plumbing skills 
that most of us who connect garden hose pipes can easily master. The valves used on the bags are an example 
of keeping it simple with an intuitive way of switching it off and on. Also, for my own interest, 
I started to gather data on how 
much I was drinking and volumes when emptying my bag ( inputs and outputs in engineering terminology ), 
which produced a fascinating insight into how my body 
was working. Given the problem that the catheter is managing - emptying urine from my body - and the constraints of 
everyday use, the one I used worked well.
</p>

<p>
One final point. The District Nurses gave me great practical advice based on their experience 
of helping other people managing their catheters. For any medical device designer getting feedback from the 
people who are using it is an invaluable source of information for revisions to the design. In general, the users of medical devices
can very often find better solutions to the problems of using it even if 
it involves

<p>
Next time I am sitting in the waiting room of my medical centre, probably listening to some John Lennon 
classics, I will be reflecting on the many people, over the centuries, who developed the urinary
catheter and how the current version saved me from torturous pain !

Big thanks to the Doctors, Nurse Practitioners, District Nurses, and the people in the Dispensary 
for their professionalism and kindness during my urinary problem.
