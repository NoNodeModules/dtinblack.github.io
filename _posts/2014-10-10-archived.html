title: Lessons From Books To Improve The Web
description: Key learning from books to improve the Web’s educational capability.

<p>
The Web is an incredible source for learning.  
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>
and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course" target="_blank">MOOCs</a>
are amongst the many great examples. 
However, there is always room for improvement. In too many case it is full: opinions, guesses, soap box 
rants and somebody else’s quotes, which are wrapped in wooly sentences. To learn I need to find the 
answer to the ‘why’ question rather than the ‘what’. Whether it is about the mysterious statements made 
by <a href="http://www.apolloschildren.com/" target="_blank">Professor Brian Cox</a>, 
repairing a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derailleur_gears" target="_blank">Derailleur</a>,
or why a football team is playing 
<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/aug/29/louis-van-gaal-manchester-united-352-tactics" target="_blank">3-5-2</a>
rather than 4-4-2. Therefore wading through clutter trying to answer the ‘why’ question is not helpful.
</p> 

<p>
So how can the web be improved? Lessons can be learned from the technology that has been around for sometime: 
books. Over the years authors have emerged who have shown some key characteristics that help readers learn 
about subjects
</p>

<p>
Clear writing expresses clear thoughts, which leads to better understanding of a subject. The best of the pack 
is Richard Feynman who can take the unreal world of quantum mechanics and leave the reader wondering how 
their cup of coffee stays together.  Amongst his books there are many examples: 
<a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Uv-uxB0sRKEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=QED+-+The+strange+theory+of+light+and+matter&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Pu5HVI2DBcLO7gbj0ICwBQ&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=QED%20-%20The%20strange%20theory%20of%20light%20and%20matter&f=false"
target="_blank">QED - The Strange Theory of 
Light and Matter</a> or for more depth the three volume 
<a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bDF-uoUmttUC&dq=feynman+lectures+on+physics&hl=en&sa=X&ei=zO5HVNSDDbSS7Aah6ICIDg&redir_esc=y"
target="_blank">Feynman Lectures on Physics</a>.  
</p>

<p>
Along with the great certainties in life: death and paying taxes should be included following a recipe.  
My experience has been frustrating. I struggle to get anywhere near the high resolution picture shown in 
the recipe books. Putting to one side my lack of skill and experience, I have found many of the recipes 
have included the wrong baking temperatures, incorrect ingredients, and even missing ingredients! Checking, 
testing and checking again are required for a recipies to tease out the mistakes. However the gold standard 
for any cookbook is anything written by Delia Smith, in particular 

<a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bP_Aznsy9TYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Delia%E2%80%99s+Complete+How+To+Cook&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Ye9HVO3YOcbl7gaKvoDIDw&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Delia%E2%80%99s%20Complete%20How%20To%20Cook&f=false"
target="_blank">Delia’s Complete How To Cook</a> and 

<a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=YLKTQQAACAAJ&dq=Delia%E2%80%99s+Complete+How+To+Cook&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Ye9HVO3YOcbl7gaKvoDIDw&redir_esc=y"
target="_blank">Delia's Complete Cookery Course</a>. The recipes work and look like the pictures.

Many books I read seem to be a compilation of old lecture notes, TV scripts or a thesis with minimal editing 
and therefore it feels like reading a tax form ! Therefore, enthusiasm for the subject is critical because 
it feeds through into the writing and keeps the pages turning. All the authours mentioned above have it, 
and so does Stephen Fry.  In his book 

<a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=_WxhaCrAc6gC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Ode+Less+Travelled:+Unlocking+the+Poet+Within&hl=en&sa=X&ei=JfBHVIOEL5K07QahwoHoAQ&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=The%20Ode%20Less%20Travelled%3A%20Unlocking%20the%20Poet%20Within&f=false"
target="_blank">The Ode Less Travelled: Unlocking the Poet Within</a> he takes the reader 
through the different forms of poetry and is carefully illustrated with examples. The writing bubbles with 
enthusiasm, and his style holds the nervous reader hand while they tap out their first iambic pentameter.
</p>

<p>
There are many more examples that demonstrate clarity, accuracy and enthusiasm, and some may be on your 
bookshelf. So a challenge to all you web bound authours, before you hit the keyboards, please write clearly, 
check and double check what you are writing about, and pump up the enthusiasm! Follow this and the Web will 
be a greater force for learning.
