title: Reset Seven - The Gap
description: Challenges in developing a writing style. 
---

<p>
Looking back over the last few posts it is becoming clear that my style needs to change. 
Although their content is technically, and hopefully, interesting the style is too abstract.  
The aim of the blog is to write clearly about subjects that I find interesting; in a way 
that reaches a wide audience.  Looking over the posts it is clear that I am interested 
in mainly technical subjects e.g. mathematics, physics, health and some aspect of business.  
All these subjects are technical in nature and therefore the writing style is very factual 
and dry. 
</p>

<p>
At the heart of the challenge that I have set myself is trying to merge, or at least partly 
overlap, two different types of writing style. On the one hand there are those who a read 
literature and on the other those who read technical subjects.  I enjoy both areas. Research 
points to the fact that it is very rare that the two come together. The closest examples are 
biographies, or autobiographies, of scientists, mathematicians or engineers. However, with 
most of these the balance is more to towards a story format rather than understanding their 
technical breakthrough 
</p>

<p>
To illuminate the gap between the two types of writing style lets explore two examples at 
each end of  the spectrum.  In Laurie Lee’s <i>Cider With Rosie</i> he describes his new 
home: “That was the day we came to the village, in the summer of the last year of the First 
World War. To a cottage that stood in half-acre of garden on a steep back above a lake; a 
cottage with three floors and a cellar and a treasure in the walls, with a pump and apple 
trees, syringe and strawberries, rooks in the chimney, frogs in the cellar, mushrooms on the 
ceiling, and all for three and sixpence a week”.  Compare with a report on the condition of 
Hut 6 at Bletchley Park where the Enigma code was broken during the  
Second World War: “Entering through the side door, a short transverse corridor joins the 
main central corridor, which runs from north to south. This corridor is broken by two fire 
doors, the southernmost containing the door from room 10. The wooden floor was covered in 
linoleum, some of which survives. The floor has rotted in places, making rooms 3, 4 and 15 
inaccessible. The walls and ceilings are lined with boarding which has sagged and collapsed 
in places, revealing roof trusses comprising a king post and diagonal braces. Supporting 
the tie beams, under the ceilings, are small brackets with a sunken triangle motif on their 
sides. Two types of door are used.” One gives a description of a place through young eyes 
with a sense of excitement. The other is purely factual: describing the condition of a 
building before restoration.  One appeals to the emotions the other is factual.  
</p>

<p>
In conclusion, the first challenge is finding a balance between using an emotional style 
writing style with a factual style that will engage a wide audience.
