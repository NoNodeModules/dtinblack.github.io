title:  Vote For Mathematics 
description: A different approach to promoting mathematics ?  
---

<p>
The status of mathematics in the UK continues to struggle.  Statistics about the subject continue to 
make bleak reading:  1 in 5 students continue with mathematics beyond CGSE level,  
<a href="http://www.nationalnumeracy.org.uk/essentials-numeracy-all" _target="blank">49% of Adults</a> have 
numeracy level expected at  primary school, and the UK languishes in 26th position in the Programme for 
International Student Assessment 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PISA_2012" _target="blank">( PISA )</a> World League Table. Also, 
I suspect that if I went into a coffee as shop and carried out a quick poll amongst the customers 
what they thought about mathematics I would probably get banned for disturbing the peace!
</p>

<p>
So what can be done to generate and enthusiasm for mathematics?  Maybe there are learning’s 
from  other areas of life ? 
</p>

<p>
During the recent 2105 UK Election campaigns it was clear that each political party had well oiled 
campaigning machines. Therefore investigating how a campaign is run could give us a few insights on 
what could be done to improve the enthusiasm for mathematics. 
</p>

<p>
Lynton Crosby, the mastermind behind the successful Conservative party campaign, in 2013 gave a masterclass for the 
<a href="http://www.patchworkfoundation.org.uk/master-class-with-lynton-crosby-ao/" _target="blank">Patchwork Foundation</a>
where he makes a number of points that could be adapted for an effective mathematics campaign. 
</p>

<p>
First, what is the message that we are trying to get over about mathematics and why would it be 
relevant to the audience for the message? Most, if not all, initiatives to promote mathematics have 
remained abstract and usually discuss the subject at a level beyond most people’s level of understanding, 
and therefore fail to connect with everyday life.  What is needed is the message about how mathematics 
affects people’s lives.
</p>

<p>
Crosby went onto explain that in campaigning there is broadly three targets audiences:  The Base, The 
Swing Group, and Anti (opponents). It is important to lock The Base in, The Swing are the bricks on 
top of the foundation and not to waste effort on the Anti's. Therefore make sure that The Base of 
enthusiasm for mathematics is held onto and developed, then go onto capture the group who know that 
mathematics is important but haven’t done much about learning more. 
</p>


<p>
Who should deliver the message? Mathematics needs a 
<a href="http://www.physics.manchester.ac.uk/our-research/research-impact/brian-cox-effect/" _target="blank">
‘Brian Cox Effect’</a>, 
which has increased university 
applications for physics by over 50% and sold over 1 million popular science books. But as well as a 
figure head, the campaign needs a team to disseminate the underlying elements of the message to a wide 
audience as possible and include both media and social media. 
</p>

<p>
With a campaign measuring how well the message is being received by the target audience is essential.  
A new set of benchmarks should developed, for example measuring how many adults have used  compound 
interest ( something that should be important with the new de-regulation in UK pensions ) and why. 
</p>

<p>
Finally Lynotn Crosby quotes Richard Wirthlin, Ronald Reagan’s campaign strategist, “persuade through 
reason and motivate through emotion”. Mathematics needs to press a few emotional buttons other than fear!
</p>

<p>
I am looking forward to the day when I walk into a coffee shop and people are busily discussing compound 
interest !
