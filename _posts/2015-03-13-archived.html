title:  Bayes Theorem Part 2 – Marbleous Probabilities!  
description: Explaining probability.
---

<p>
The challenge of finding a clear description of Bayes Theorem on the web was described in the 
<a href="http://dtinblack.github.io/2015/02/13/archived.html" target="_blank">first post</a>
of this series.  This post introduces a key building block in developing an understanding of Bayes 
Theorem - probability.
</p>

<p>
In our daily communication we mark uncertainty of something happening by using the word “probably”, 
for example in phrases such as “It will probably rain tomorrow”, or  “The package will probably arrive 
today”. Sometimes in our discussions we try and rate the level of uncertainty of something happening 
by using words such as: impossible, unlikely, maybe, likely or certain. 
</p>

<p>
Since the early 18th century mathematicians have been working on ideas to quantify the level of 
uncertainty of something happening whether it is going to rain, parcels arriving or the winning 
race horse at Cheltenham.  The measure of uncertainty that they developed is called a probability 
and it quantifies the chance that something will happen, or how likely some event will happen.
</p>

<p>
To illustrate the use of probabilities, lets take a bag that contains 7 red and 5 blue marbles. 
We can ask the question “What is the probability that the first marble pulled out of the bag is red ?”  
To calculate a probability we need to know what the total number of possibilities that a marble will be 
pulled out of the bag, in this case there are 12 possibilities
(  7 red and 5 blue marbles ), and the possibility of a particular event happening, which is 7 ( there are 7 
reds in the bag ).  Therefore the probability of pulling a red marble out of the bag can be can be 
( in mathematical symbols where ‘P’ equals probability ) is:

<center>P ( Red ) =  Number of red marbles / Total number of marbles</center>

<br>

<center>P ( Red ) = 7 / 12,</center>

<br>

<p>
in other words, slightly greater than 50% chance. Similarly, if we ask about the probability of pulling a 
blue marble out of the bag is: 
</p>

<center>P ( Blue ) = 5 / 12.</center>

<p>From the above,  an important property of probabilities is:</p>

<center>P ( Red ) + P ( Blue ) = 1.</center>

</p>
<p>
However, what does “probability’” really mean?  After all if I was to actually pull a marble out of the 
bag it could be red or it could be blue. Probabilities defined in the sense above allow us to assess the 
likelihood of something happening. In other words, probability does not tell us exactly what will happen it is just 
a guide.
</p>

<p>
Of course the last time many of us saw a bag of marbles was possibly at school (  where they are  probably 
banned for health and safety reasons !). However, the principles can be applied to many different problems, 
for example: chances of developing a disease, tracking terrorists, gambling, and developing computer 
algorithms learn our behaviours.
</p>

<p>
Now that we have a clearer idea on probability, in the next post we will use them in answering more complicated 
questions about uncertainty which is it the heart of Bayes Theorem.
