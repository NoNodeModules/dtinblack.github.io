title: Surely You’re Joking!  
description: Wittgenstein’s connection between jokes and philosophy
---

<p>
Jokes and philosophy are an odd combination. Philosophy is mainly academic in flavor; 
full of terminology that locks most people out. Jokes make most people laugh. However 
Norman Malcolm wrote in <b>Ludwig Wittgenstein: A Memoir</b>, that Wittgenstein remarked "that a 
serious and philosophical work could be written that would consist entirely of <i>jokes</i> (
without being facetious)". Jokes? Philosophy? Further investigation is required.

come in many forms: puns, funny gestures, pranks, irony, sarcasm, etc. 
Anything that in general makes us laughs.  Comedians, of whom there are many fine examples, 
deliver jokes. Not a stand-up philosopher. Apart from a comedian's sense of timing, in 
joke delivery, they can use gestures. Watch

and your laughing before he speaks! All skills that a philosopher lacks.
</p>

<p>
However, Wittgenstein is clear: jokes need to be written down and therefore they must make 
the reader laugh without the aid of speaking or gestures.  Some jokes that are delivered by a comedian
can be funny in writing, in particular

Wittgenstein also stresses that the jokes have not to be facetious. 
No “why did the chicken cross the road ?” type jokes. Also, he was not considering jokes 
about philosophers but rather about philosophical problems.
</p>

<p>
So what was Wittgenstein on about?  It is difficult to image Wittgenstein laughing at a joke. 
He was mostly in a state of tension with periodic bouts of suicidal thoughts.  
Although there are some remarks in Wittgenstein’s work about humour and jokes, they are never 
developed enough to gain any insight.
</p>

<p>
Early in his life Wittgenstein read Schopenhauer's work which may have influenced his ideas on 
the connection between jokes and philosophy.  Schopenhauer's view was that a joke 
lies in an object that can, at a stretch, be subsumed under a concept, even though it 
differs greatly from the objects usually subsumed under the concept. We 
laugh involuntarily when we grasp the incongruity: when we see the object doesn’t really 
fit the concept after all. Sounds complicated but an example may illustrate what he is 
getting at.  Amongst the many Spike Milligan jokes that makes me laugh is: "A man loses 
his dog, so he puts an ad in the paper. And the ad says, 'Here, boy!'” The phrase 'Hear boy’ 
said within the context of a man walking his dog in a park we immediately understand without 
any problems or confusion, if not irritated when we are lying in the sun. However when 
we move the context by placing the phrase in a newspaper we laugh at the incongruity. 
</p>

<p>
Wittgenstein’s view was that problems in philosophy arise when there is a failure 
to recognise that the words being used have lost their sense. This misuse could create an 
incongruity. Therefore when we come across a misuse of words, when they have lost their meaning, they 
could create an incongruity.  Rather than spending lots of time puzzling over 
the sentence that thy have generated we should grasp it for what it is, 
laugh, and move on.
</p>

<p>
So how would it work? My attempt is based on solipsism and goes 'A man thought he was the 
only person in the world, until he looked in the mirror’. Would Wittgenstein have laughed ? 
Maybe not but I would hope for a smile.
