title:  Football - Art Or Science ?  
description: Could there ever be a scientific approach to football?

<p>
I enjoy watching football, and if time permitted, I would watch more. I watch it on television, 
Premiership League reserve game's or the local pub team at the weekend. The fascination with the game 
is watching two teams of skilled players passing the ball that seems to zig zag over a field which eventually 
opens up a chance to score a goal.

<p>
To understand football you need to delve into its language which is full of: wing backs, center forwards, 
mid-fielders, the gaffer, which are names that sound as though they should be part of a chess game. 
There are the machine gun numbers : 4-4-2, 3-5-1, and 4-1-3-2 which describes each teams 
formation on the pitch, or at least the formation that they should be playing ! Then there is the 
referee who can control the flow of the game that turn on decisions made in an instance, usually 
with no clear view of the incidents; under and pressure from half a stadium full of screaming fans who are 
absolutely sure that you are wrong !

The part of football that I concentrate on is the path that ball makes around the park; how each 
team, and the players within the team, make the ball move to find enough space to take a shot on goal. 
Today increasing amount of data can be gathered about players: the amount of passes, pass success rate, 
distance ran throughout a match and so on. Football has entered into the era of Analytics where massive 
amounts of data are computed to find patterns. The patterns that can be found about a player within a 
team can affect their future and their value to both the team and the club. But this seems 
to me that it is like analysing chess pieces rather than the game.

Some commentators compare football with a game of chess. In some aspects this is correct. There are 
the players = chess pieces, football pitch = chess board, both games have rules etc. But the analogy 
quickly breaks down. For example, although the coach maybe considered the ‘chess player’ they usually 
have very little control over the pieces. Also, the coach can only see parts of the field at any one 
time, where as chess players can see the whole board in an instance. However, the most important 
difference is that football is dynamic: player’s positions are constantly changing, and they influence 
the play of not only their teammates but the opposition. When was the last time that you say a knight on a chess 
board having a bad day !

approach to the game, which he calls 
<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-30290540" target="_blank">Law Of Cumulation</a>
( whose principles he learnt from 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Clough" target="_blank">Brian Clough</a>
), may give us more insight. The laws 
states that that a football match consists of thousands of incidents which can win or loose 
a game.  Missing a tackle can result in a goal a few minutes later. Therefore analysing all 
of the events and how they are linked together may give new insight into this wonderful game.
