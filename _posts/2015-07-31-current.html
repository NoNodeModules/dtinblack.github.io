title:  Doctor ... Am I False Positive ?
description: Description of the medical terminology ‘false positive’.
---

<p>
Medical terminology is full of complicated terms.  It sounds like another world. Words 
such as rhinorrhea ( runny nose), cerumen ( ear wax ) and epistaxis ( nosebleed ) map out 
a land where only a few can tread. Recently, the terminology that caught my attention is  
“false positive” which seems like a riddle posed by Yoda for ‘Young Skywalker’ in Star Wars. 
How can something be “false” and yet  “positive” ? But before we crack this riddle we need 
some background.
</p>

<p>
Developing a medical test is subject to many constraints. For example, the test should 
ideally be non-invasive, easy to use, and be low  cost. Also, the complexity of the human 
body and our current levels of knowledge about a particular disease all result in medical 
tests that are rarely 100% accurate. Accuracy is important. For example if a test is 90% 
accurate then 90 tests out of 100 on people with the disease will return a positive result. 
However, for the remaining 10 tests the results will be wrong. 
</p>

<p>
To illustrate the situation let’s take an example. Prostate Specific Antigen ( PSA ) is a 
test used to detect prostrate cancer. There is a lot of 
<a href="http://www.cancerscreening.nhs.uk/prostate/prostate-patient-info-sheet.pdf" target="_blank">
controversy about the accuracy of the PSA test 
</a>
but for the purposes of this example we will assume that it is 33% accurate. 
It is important to note that if the test result is positive it does not mean that there 
is a probability of 33% of having prostrate cancer. To work out the probability of having 
prostrate cancer following a positive result an estimate of the number of men in a population 
will have cancer is required. For this example we will assume that in the UK men between 40 
to 59 is around 17 Million with an estimate of 1 in 38 who will have prostrate cancer.  
</p>

<p>
The following steps work towards answering question: if the result of a PSA test is positive what 
is the probability of having prostrate cancer ? :

<p>
1 ) The number of men in the population estimated to have prostrate cancer is  450,000 ( = 17,000,000 / 38 ).  
</p>

<p>
2 ) The men with prostrate cancer who will test positive is 150,000 ( = 450,000 / 3 ).
</p>

<p>
3 ) The men who test positive and don’t have prostrate cancer is 11,000,000 ( = ( 17,000,000 – 450,000 ) * 2 
/ 3 ). This is the size of the ‘false positive’ result. 
</p>

<p>
Therefore across the population of 17 Million men, 11,150,000 ( = 150,000 + 11,000,000 ) will 
test positive for prostrate cancer.
</p>
</p>

<p>
From the numbers above the probability of having prostrate cancer if the test result is positive 
is approximately 1 % ( = 150,000 / 11,150,000 ) . Also, the probability of a ‘false positive’ result 
is 99% ( = 11,000,000 / 11,150,000 ). Therefore a high probability of a ‘false positive’ indicates that 
there is a low probability of having the disease.  
</p>

<p>
When a test has a low accuracy then more medical tests have to be performed. For example when using the PSA 
test for prostrate cancer, the results from ultrasounds scan or a biopsy maybe included before a diagnosis 
is reached. 
</p>

<p>
Next time your doctor suggests a test to diagnose a disease that you may have, why don’t 
you ask about the probability of a ‘false positive’ result. It may not put your mind to rest 
but it may reduce the terminology fog and then you can concentrate on getting better !
