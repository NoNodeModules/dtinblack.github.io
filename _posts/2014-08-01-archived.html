title: Wittgenstein In A Few Minutes 
description: Short introduction to Wittgenstein’s solution to philosophical problems.
---

<p>
Wittgenstein&#39;s approach to solving problems in philosophy was based on his insight that they resulted 
from a misuse of language. 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unsolved_problems_in_philosophy" target="_blank">Philosophical problems</a>
were created because the meaning of the words used in 
the problems had lost their meaning, their sense. They had become &#34;nonsense&#34;.  Therefore a clearer 
understanding of how words gained their meaning would solve philosophical problems by showing that 
they were not problems other than a misuse of language. This approach was radically different than previous 
philosophers who had either constructed theories, build systems or develop finally wrought arguments to 
attempt a solution to philosophical problems.
</p> 

<p>
Wittgenstein&#39;s view was that we ask questions that chime with philosophy such as: &#34;What is reality ?&#34;, 
&#34;Can beauty be defined ?&#34;, &#34;How true is the colour green ?&#34;, and so on. The words: &#34;reality&#34;
, &#34;beauty&#34;,&#34;green&#34; etc. have lost their meaning. They were taken out of their everyday use. 
Therefore his insight is that &#34; &#46;&#46;&#46; 

<a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wittgenstein/#Mea" target="_blank">the meaning of a word is its use in the language</a>
&#34;. An important 
consequence of this approach is that words get their meaning from their public use. 
</p>

<p>
Words can have different meanings within a given context. Take for example the word &#34;number&#34;.  In every day 
life a questions such as &#34;What number is on the back of his football shirt ?&#34;, or &#34;give me a number between 
1 and 10 ?&#34; can be successfully answered. However, the question &#34;What is a number?&#34;, and many philosophy 
books are published without a clear answer.

<p>
Wittgenstein&#39;s insight came to him in Cambridge while passing a game of football, that  &#34; &#46;&#46;&#46; that in language we play 
with words&#34;.  Words get their meaning from their use. For example, the word &#34;football&#34; gets its meaning 
from game football. No football no game of football. The meaning of words can have different shades depending upon 
their context. In both football and tennis a &#34;ball&#34; is central to the game – with out a ball there would be no 
game. However, they are different sizes. If we used a tennis ball to play football it may still be called 
football but not how we would normally understand the game. There are many words where their meaning depends 
on their context. Therefore Wittgenstein’s solution to philosophical problems was to show through examples, 
rather than produce an argument,  where the words had been pushed so far 
out of their normal use that they had lost their meaning, their sense had been drained. 
</p>

<p>
Although the philosophical problems used as examples above may seem esoteric it is interesting to observe how 
being aware of how words are being used is still important. For example, in the fight against dementia a 
question that crops up is &#34;What is a memory ?&#34;, or in Computer Science &#34;Can a computer think ?&#34; or in research 
on the brain &#34;Where is consciousness ?&#34; A Wittgenstein approach may not resolve the underlying problems 
but it may show if sensible questions are being asked.
