title: Wittgenstein In A Few Minutes 
description: Short introduction to Wittgenstein’s solution to philosophical problems.
---

<p>
Wittgenstein&#39;s approach to solving philosophical problems was based on his insight that they resulted 
from a misuse of language. 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unsolved_problems_in_philosophy" target="_blank">They 
</a> arose
when the meaning of the words used to pose the problems had lost their meaning and therefore 
the philosophical problems were "nonsense". Therefore a clearer 
understanding of how words gained their meaning would solve philosophical problems by showing that 
they were not problems but a confused use of language. This approach was radically different than previous 
philosophers who had either constructed theories, built systems or develop finally wrought arguments to 
solve philosophical problems.
</p> 

<p>
Wittgenstein&#39;s insight was that when we ask questions that are philosophical in nature
such as: &#34;What is reality ?&#34;, 
&#34;Can beauty be defined ?&#34;, &#34;How true is the colour green ?&#34;, and so on. The words: &#34;reality&#34;
, &#34;beauty&#34;,&#34;green&#34; etc. have lost their meaning. Wittgenstein's position was that  
<a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wittgenstein/#Mea" target="_blank">" ...the meaning of a word is its use in the language"</a>
. 
An important 
consequence of this approach is that words get their meaning from their public use. 
</p>

<p>
Words can have different meanings within a given context. Take for example the word &#34;number&#34;.  In every day 
life a questions such as &#34;What number is on the back of his football shirt ?&#34;, or &#34;give me a number between 
1 and 10 ?&#34; can be successfully answered. However, the question &#34;What is a number?&#34;, and has generated 
many books without a clear answer.
</p>


<p>
Wittgenstein&#39;s insight came to him in Cambridge while passing a game of football, that  &#34; &#46;&#46;&#46; that in language we play 
with words&#34;.  Words get their meaning from their use. For example, the word &#34;football&#34; gets its meaning 
from game football. No football - no game of football. The meaning of words can have different shades depending upon 
their context. In both football and tennis a &#34;ball&#34; is central to the game – with out a ball there would be no 
game. However, they are different sizes. If we used a tennis ball to play football it may still be called 
football but not how we would normally understand the game. Therefore Wittgenstein’s solution to philosophical 
problems was to show through examples, 
rather than produce an argument,  where the words being used in the philosophical problem had been pushed so far 
out of their normal use that they had lost their meaning. 
</p>

<p>
Although the philosophical problems used as examples above may seem esoteric it is interesting to  
be aware of how words are being used in other types of problem. For example, in the fight against dementia a 
question that crops up is &#34;What is a memory ?&#34;, or in Computer Science &#34;Can a computer think ?&#34; or in research 
on the brain &#34;Where is consciousness ?&#34; A Wittgenstein approach may not resolve the underlying problems 
but it will show if sensible questions are being asked.
