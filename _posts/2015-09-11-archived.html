title: The Great White Shark In 200 Years 
description: What makes a sustainable business ?
---

<p>
Sometimes two ideas collide and thoughts fly in all directions. Even more when the ideas come from diverse 
areas. For example I recently had an interesting 
discussion with a teacher about sustainability. In particular how the many government sponsored 
initiatives lack any sustainability and once the money was dried up they faded out. In another 
direction, I watched an interview with the famous golfer Greg Norman ( whose nickname is The 
Great White Shark ) who is a very successful in 
<a href="http://www.shark.com/" target="_blank">business.</a>
Towards the end of <a href="http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Journal/Issues/2015/05/25/Opinion/From-The-Executive-Editor.aspx" target="_blank">the interview</a>
he started talking about a 200-year horizon for his business. He put forward the case that 
it was about creating a solid business that would support customers, employees and suppliers 
which would outlive his and their children’s children: a form of sustainability. So what 
makes something sustainable and last for more than 200 years ?  
</p>

<p>
A few obvious examples are the many stately homes, castles and estates that have been around for 
more than 200-years.  Then there are the ancient trees that have weathered many storms for 
hundreds of years but maybe facing their greatest storm from pollution. In the world of 
business there are many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_oldest_companies" target="_blank">companies</a> 
that have been in business for over 200 years including 
some of my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_oldest_companies" target="_blank">favourites:</a> 
Shepard Neames ( Brewer since 1698 ) with their wonderful beer and 
Mornflakes ( Oats and cereals since 1675 ) that helps me get started every morning.  But 
what about insititutions ? marriage ? religion ? education ? And then there are ideas: 
democracy ? free speech ? human rights ? What about our current technology ?  Will 
smart phones and the Internet exist in 200 year times ? As the two ideas of sustainability 
and a 200-year horizon collided the number of questions drown out possible answers.
</p>

<p>
Are there any common threads from the examples above ( and the many more that have 
not been covered ) ?  It is difficult to pull together any coherent themes but after a few 
cups of coffee I had a few thoughts. 
</p>

<p>
Business longevity depends on a core product e.g. food and drink that is adapted for the changes 
in customers behaviours and preferences. Packaging may change, marketing channels redirected but 
the core products will have been the same for hundreds of years. Good quality products go on 
forever. Also, most appear to be run by families, which suggests that the core values 
of the business are more easily passed onto the subsequent generations.
</p>

<p>
For sustainable technology the simpler the better ( or made as simple as possible ). Some examples 
of devices are: water taps, pen 
and paper, light switches, and so. We use theses devices everyday without any thought ( unless 
they go wrong !).  Also, the technology must become an integral way of life, something we couldn’t 
live without  ( imagine the chaos if the Internet was switched off !  or domestic water suddenly dried up !).
</p>

<p>
I hope that Greg Norman’s business develops some of the attributes discussed above, and 
is still around in 200 years so that my great-great-great-great-great-great-grandchildren can play golf !
