title: The Crisp Challenge
subtitle: Predicting the future of a person's health ?

<p>Every Friday at 9 o&#39;clock the fridge door is swung open and bottles of beer are popped open, glasses of 
wine filled up and crisps are turned out into large bowls surrounded with a selection of dips. It is 
family ritual that happens throughout the year, and in any location in the world. However we can&#39;t claim 
originality. It started many years ago after watching a documentary about the adventures of 
<a href="http://www.chayblyth.com/" target="_blank">Sir Chey Blythe</a> 
No mater where he was in the world between 6 and 7 in the evening he and the crew would stop whatever they 
were doing and drink a few glasses of whiskey. It was a moment in a dangerous and hectic life when they 
could stop and take in the fantastic scenery, and put life back into some sort of perspective. What was good 
for Sir Chey is good for us.  Our ritual has developed into a period when we can come together as a family, 
catch up and steady the ship  a stormy week.</p>

<p>However, during the last few years like a head win that has sprung out of nowhere the &#39;H&#39; word 
started to creep into our family ritual with gusts of : &#39;Is this good for our health ?&#39;,&#39;What impact is 
this doing to our health ?&#39; and &#39;Shouldn&#39;t we have less crisps?&#39;.  There is no doubt that our slug of  
beer-wine-crisps-dips is the top side of the recommended daily intake of calories but like a weather beaten 
sea dog I face resolutely into the head wind.</p> 

<p>Medical progress is accelerating and exciting new discoveries are announced every 
week. The dropping price of technology has allowed the development of &#34;fitness bands&#34; and other wearable 
sensors that can measure our vital signs. All this and the vast amount of medical information available 
on the web have contributed to improving health.  But one of the biggest impacts on health remains diet 
and there seems to be only generalisations with &#39;Eat a balanced diet&#39; or the sea sawing between &#39;red wine 
is okay&#39;, &#39;red win is not okay&#39; or &#39;too much butter is bad for you&#39;, &#39;but 
some butter is okay&#39; and so it goes on.</p>

<p>Therefore it seems to be difficult is an accurate prediction of an individual&#39;s health from diet, and 
in particular its impact on how long we will live.  If only we could predict the impact of what we eat on 
how long we would live. Therefore I have developed The Crisp Bag Challenge, which is, if I eat another bag 
of crisps during our family get together how many hours, minutes or even seconds will it reduce my life 
span? Of course I offer no prizes if it can be achieved except that the knowledge that you will have resolved
a dispute around a fridge. In the meantime we will still be looking forward 
to our Friday night drinks, imaging Sir Chey Blyth, glass in hand, out on the open seas.</p>
