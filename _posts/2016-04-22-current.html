description: Short note about a MOOC Journalism Course.

<p>
Dear Reader,  
</p>

<p>
I am currently engrossed in a MOOC produced by 
<a href="https://www.futurelearn.com/" target="_blank">Future Learn</a> called  
<a href="https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/introduction-to-journalism" >Introduction to Journalism</a>.
The course covers different types of journalism: news, feature, editorials etc. with the 
associated writing styles. Interesting but hard work. However, I am confident that it will help 
my writing style.
