title: Can Mathematics Make Us Happy ?
description: Using the emotional aspects of mathematics to improve its use.
---

<p>
Perdiodically the state of mathematics in the UK bubbles to the top of the news with headlines such as: 
<a href="http://www.nationalnumeracy.org.uk/what-issue" target="_blank">"Numeracy skills have got worse, not better"</a>,
<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-32608772" target="_blank">"Asia tops biggest global school rankings"</a>, and
<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2517834/Britains-stagnating-schools-UK-teenagers-slip-world-league-maths-science-reading.html#ixzz495OXvinf" target="_blank" >"Britain's stagnating schools: UK teenagers slip down world league in maths, science and reading"</a>.
Experts opinion are sought on the state of the subject and they give advice on what needs to be done ( which usually requires more money ). 
Journalists bounce the subject around: 
<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/18/maths-more-pointless-than-latin-british-pupils-china" target="_blank">"For Britain's pupils, maths is even more pointless than Latin"</a>, 
<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/11/maths-isnt-problem-curriculum-lacking-imagination" target="_blank">"Maths isn’t the problem - the way it’s taught is"</a>, and
<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/feb/23/maths-teaching-revolution-needed-conrad-wolfram" target="_blank">"The UK needs a revolution in the way maths is taught. Here's why…"</a>.
Government ministers respond with tweaks to the mathematics curriculum fully expecting a swift implementation.  
But the topic sinks back down to the lower depths of the public consciousness. Until the next survey sparks 
another heated debate.
</p>

<p>
Part of the problem with developing skills in mathematics is failing to recognise that mathematics is a 
language. The language that we use everyday is full of words and sentences that allows us to navigate 
through the complexities of life. 
Mathematics consists of equations full of additions, subtractions, multiplication and divisions that are used 
to quantify the amount of money in our banks, search for the best deals and and count the number of days left before our 
next holiday. Therefore like any other language, our skill in its use is linked to how important it is in our 
lives.
</p>

<p>
The reality is that  outside the professional use of mathematics ( for example in science, engineering and 
technology ) there is no real appetite for developing skills in 
mathematics. Although our lives are dominated by numbers: price of milk, temperature at the beach, 
time of the next train, there is a need rarely analyse and manipulate the numbers. Then there is
the dreaded ‘x’ and ‘y’.  Picking up five apples from the supermarket shelves which are round, 
feel firm , look and smell delicious. But when we try to 
represent the number of apples by the abstract letter ‘x’ a fog of confusion sets in. We can eat an apple but not a 
cross on a piece of paper.
</p>

<p>
In a market economy where we make choices our mathematical skills are important. If we cannot 
quantify and manipulate numbers then how do we know what is the best energy deal, or the best insurance policy, or is the that two for 
one deal really a deal ? Even equations have an important role in our lives. When understood mathematical symbols can 
unlock a new set of skills that can have many applications, for example working out compound interest ( important in 
calculating the amount of money required for a happy retirement). 
</p>

<p>
So what can be done ?
</p>

<p>
There are enough 
reasons that should persuade people about the use of mathematics and its importance: managing household budgets, 
improved job opportunities, transfereable skills, planning for the future, improved critical thinking and so on. 
But is there are two emotional challenges: the barriers that set in when learning about the subject at school, 
and the enjoyment in using mathematics in the way that we live. Both of these hurdles are linked: 
improved learning experience at school would put in the ground work for enjoying the subject later in life.
Therefore the challenge ( and plea ) to mathematics teachers, authors, experts, 
governments and industry is to overcome the emotional barriers by analysing what fears need to be overcome 
rather than drowning us with another survey about our lack of mathematical skill. What would it take to 
make us happy when using mathematics ?
