title: How Computers View the World  
description: Using variables and algorithms to solve problems
---

<p>
Computer technology has a fundamental impact on the way that we live.  Although we are more digitally 
connected through the use of mobile phones and the Internet it is their ability to manipulate large 
amounts of data at lightening speeds that have shaped the world that we live in. This ability allows 
companies like Amazon to process thousands of purchases every minute and, arrange for them to be delivered 
to our doorstep. Or help us drive safely at the same time as minimizing fuel consumption and pollution.  
At the heart of the ability to process information that can solve problems, a computer uses two ideas that 
go hand-in-hand: variables and algorithms. 
</p> 

<p>
As the name suggest a variable describes a quantity that can vary. There are many examples in everyday 
life. For example the describing the weather which can use lots of variables: temperature, rainfall, 
wind speed, humidity etc. some which can vary dramatically! Variables are in two parts: a name for 
example &#34;temperature&#34;, and a value, for example 20 degrees centigrade. A variable can have many values 
such as a list. For example a variable called Address Book with values being the list of 
names and addresses.
</p>

<p>
A computer manipulates variables using algorithms. Algorithms are a series of steps that we take to 
solve problems. There are many non-computer examples. When we drive from home to say a supermarket the 
journey is broken down into down into a series of steps: jump on the car, switch it on, drive onto the 
main road, turn left at the lights etc. until we reach the destination. Similarly examples are following 
a recipe, recording a TV program. There are many more examples where we follow a series of steps to 
complete a task. 
</p>

<p>
Algorithms are more complicated than following one step after another. Returning to the supermarket 
example. What happens if there has been an accident on the route to the supermarket? You might take 
a different route to get to the supermarket. We have now added a condition to our supermarket 
algorithm - if the road is blocked then I will use another route. The if-then statement - if something 
happens then will do something  else - is an example of how an algorithm can be enriched to carry out 
more complicated information processing. There are many more enhancements to algorithms, which allow 
more complicated problems to be solved.  Have you ever wondered how Amazon knows which books to suggest? 
Or Google shows relevant advertisers on your web page? It is very complex algorithms working on a vast 
number of variables that are gathering data about our on-line shopping habits. Algorithm development 
remains one of the most actively researched areas.

<p>
Computers continue to get faster and handle large amounts of data which will continue to shape the world 
that we live in but at the heart of their success will remain the two interlocked ideas of variables 
and algorithms.
