title: Wittgenstein On Markets 
description: Analysing word usage to segment markets.
---

<p>
Recently I was involved in generating ideas for digital products that targeted the learning 
market.  It was loads of fun, filling up walls with brightly coloured stikies but I felt 
frustrated. It was creativity without a purpose. Identifying the problems that people were 
experiencing, then developing solutions would have been a better approach.

<p>
I decided to follow my own advice and repeat the exercise but this time starting from the 
problems that people were experiencing when trying to learn. Using my trusty search engine 
I started to skim over the web searching for information about the current markets for 
learning products and the problems that they are facing. But I soon ran into problems. Words 
and phrases were firing out that created confusion: tertiary education, training-the-trainer, 
master apprentice relationships, life long learning, self-learning, and so one. 
It was a muddle ! Undeterred I carried on. But as soon as I tried to define some market 
segments new cases popped up that don’t quite fit in to my analysis. For example, in formal 
education does homework come under the category of self-learning ? Or when learning about 
fishing is ‘trail and error’ a learning model ? If it is then how effectiveness is it ? 
</p>

<p>
Turning to a philosopher from the previous century for help may appear like a 60's hippy. 
However when the philosopher is Wittgenstein then a rigorous approach will be 
imposed in trying to get a clear view of the terminology used in the range of learning 
activities.

So how can Wittgenstein help? Wittgenstein was interested in philosophical problems. He felt 
that they arose from the misuse of language, in particular when words had lost their meaning. 
Wittgenstein showed that a word gets its meaning from its use within an activity. Therefore 
his approach to solving philosophical problems was to show that the words creating the 
philosophical problem had lost their meaning.  For example the word ‘learn’ is used in many 
different contexts: “What did you learn today ?” where the reply may recount the topics 
covered by a course. “I need to learn more about fly casting” or “How do I learn about calculus ?” 
are uses that we understand without any confusion. But what about “How do I learn ?” or 
“Our organization learns very quickly” then the word ‘learn’ is taken out of its normal use,  
and starts to loose meaning usually resulting in a plethora of definitions that try to pin 
down its meaning ( check the number of definitions for  ‘knowledge’, ‘creativity’ etc. on the web ).

So what does all this mean ? There are many ways of segmenting customers into markets for 
example using key variables such as age, income, lifestyle etc. However, looking at the 
way that different groups use words to cover the activity of learning then different 
segments may be identified. Would new opportunities be opened up ? Watch this blog for 
future developments !
