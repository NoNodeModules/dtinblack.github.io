<p>During an interview with 
<a href="http://www.cprogramdevelop.com/1146132/" target="_blank">Andrei Alexandrescu</a>, a Facebook Research 
Engineer, was asked about staying up to date with technology. He replied that it is important 
to &#34Learn how to learn&#34.  But what is the best way to self-learning ? 
</p>

<p>
Self-learning is an important 
part of life whether it is driven by curiosity, hobbies or professional development, and over the  
years I developed some techniques,and borrowed from others, that broadly follows three stages.
</p>

<p>I start with identifying the people who are working on the subject that I am interested in. 
I check to see what they have written, for example blogs, papers, public presentations, books, 
or given presentations on YouTube etc.  I also check out any commentators, or critics on the 
subject. This initial phase is what I call the &#34Detective Work&#34, and Google ( or any other search engine ) 
is the key tool, but I can often be found searching along the shelves in Libraries.  My aim is to gain an 
overview of the concepts and principles underpinning the subject.</p>

<p>The next phase is &#34Immersion&#34 where I try and absorb as much of the subject that I can. Very often it feels 
like drowning in a wide range of information, some of which can be inaccessible due to the technicalities of
the subject, 
or poor writing. More searching on the web can usually find some key explanations about the subject, invariably blogs from 
people who have struggled with the same subject. Then, slowly a few parts start to make sense and a few ideas 
on the subject start to make sense.</p> 

<p>Finally I try and piece all of the reading, ideas, and thoughts together to test my understanding. The 
&#34Gluing&#34 phase. I ask myself if I really really do understand the subject. If not, 
then it is back to immersion or dig out more people. Once I have a basic idea about the subject 
then I play around with the ideas to develop and improve my understanding. This can be done more easily 
in some areas than others, for example with open source software tutorials can be followed to explore 
the idea. For other subjects then I can only read about it e.g. surgery.</p> 

<p>Of course it depends how much you want to learn about a subject. What I have described above is the 
first step.  But to gain a greater level of expertise in a subject can take many years 
( there is a debate raging on the web that suggests that around 
<a href="http://www.raspihub.com/go/a26f4163e4850beba32c9611ba59714034b57a8b8faf47820ff9380efc77b07b" target="_blank"
>10000</a> hours is required to gain a high level of expertise in a subject ). A long time but improving in 
a subject is part of the fun.</p>

<p>So these three phases DetectiveWork-Immersion-Gluing, where I make extensive notes at each stage, 
which help me learn about a new subject.</p>

<p>Why bother with all of the effort of self-learning? My favourite reply to such a question comes 
from <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Walt_Disney" target="_blank">Walt Disney</a> &#34...We keep moving 
forward, opening up new doors and doing new things, because we&#39re 
curious and curiosity keeps leading us down new paths&#34</p>
