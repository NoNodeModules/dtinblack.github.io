title: Learn how to learn
subtitle: Some ideas on self-learning 
---

<p>During an interview with 
<a href="http://www.cprogramdevelop.com/1146132/" target="_blank">Andrei Alexandrescu</a>, a Facebook Research 
Engineer, a question came up about staying up to date with technology. He replied that it is important 
to &#34Learn how to learn&#34.  But what is the best way to self-learning ? Self-learning is an important 
part of life whether it is driven by curiosity, hobbies or professional development, and over the  
years I developed some techniques,and borrowed from others, that broadly follows three stages.</p>

<p>I start with identifying the people who are working on the subject that I am interested in. 
I check to see what the have written, for example blogs, papers, public presentations, books, 
or given presentations on YouTube etc.  I also check out any commentators, or critics on the 
subject. This initial phase is what I call the &#34Detective Work&#34, and Google ( or any other search engine ) 
is the key tool, but I can often be found searching along the shelves in Libraries.  My aim is to gain an 
overview of the concepts and principles underpinning the subject.</p>

<p>The next phase is &#34Immersion&#34 where I try and absorb as much of the subject that I can. Very often it feels 
like drowning in a wide range mix of information, some of which can be inaccessible due to the technicalities, 
or poor writing. More searching on the web can usually find some key information, invariably blogs from 
people who have struggled with the subject. Then, slowly a few parts start to make sense and a few ideas 
on the subject start to make sense.</p> 

<p>Finally I try and piece all of the reading, ideas, and thoughts together to test my understanding. The 
&#34Gluing&#34 phase. I ask myself if I really really do understand the subject. If not, 
then it is back to immersion or dig out more people. Once I have a basic idea about the subject 
then I play around with the ideas to develop a improve my understanding. This can be done more easily 
in some areas than others, for example with open source software tutorials can be followed to explore 
the idea. For other subjects then I can only read about e.g. surgery.</p> 

<p>Of course it depends how much you want to learn about a subject. What I have described alone is the 
first step and if it is important, and there is a debate raging on the web that suggest that around 
<a href="http://www.raspihub.com/go/a26f4163e4850beba32c9611ba59714034b57a8b8faf47820ff9380efc77b07b" target="_blank"
>10000</a> hours is required to gain a high level of expertise in a subject. A long time but improving in 
an area is part of the fun.</p>

<p>So these three phases DetectiveWork-Immersion-Gluing, where I make extensive notes at each stage, 
help me learn about a new subjects, which can be anything from art to quantum physics, philosophy 
to computer technology.</p>

<p>Why bother with all of the effort of self-learning? My favourite reply to such a question comes 
from <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Walt_Disney" target="_blank">Walt Disney</a> &#34...We keep moving 
forward, opening up new doors and doing new things, because we&#39re 
curious and curiosity keeps leading us down new paths&#34</p>
