title: My Art Highlights from 2015   
description: My top three art highlights from 2015.  
---

<p>
At this time of the year I look back over the notes, bookmarks, and collections in apps such as 
<a href="https://www.pinterest.com/" target="_blank">Pinterest </a>and 
<a href="https://https://www.tumblr.com/"target="_blank">Tumblr</a>
that I have collected on what I consider ‘art’. Of course the word ‘art’ can start 
an endless debate about what it means, what should it include, and why is it important. Rather 
than launching a thousand research projects on the subject, the working definition that I use is: 
anything that I find interesting that is outside of subjects such as mathematics, technology, 
engineering, science and entertainment (crude I known but it works for me). The art that I 
discover spring out of a number of sources: books, music, newspapers, search engine suggestions, 
television, social media, exhibitions, posters and so on. What passes as a piece of art is something 
that asks a question about how I live,  and the world that I live in.  Unlike most bloggers at this 
time of the year I have narrowed the selection from the usual ‘Top Ten” to the following three which are not
in any particular order. 
</p>

<p>
Books remain an important source for art ( using my definition described above ), and there have been 
many interesting reads during 2015: Colm Tóibín’s
 <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-KYpwPcjlgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Mother+and+Sons+tolbin&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Mother%20and%20Sons%20tolbin&f=false"
 target="_blank">Mother and Sons</a>
( one of the great short story writers ), and 
<a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=PQNfwKOYEj0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Just+Kids&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj314OU1YXKAhXCzxQKHctrC4kQ6AEILjAA"
target="_blank">Just Kids</a>
by Patti Smith ( her life in New York during the late 60s and 70s described in a rich language). 
But one book stood out in during the year was 
<a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=aN8tBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Birth+of+a+Theorem&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=The%20Birth%20of%20a%20Theorem&f=false"
target="_blank">The Birth of a Theorem: A Mathematical Adventure</a>
by Cédric Villani. 
Let me state immediately that I didn’t understand the equations described in the book, and I doubt that 
outside a very narrow band of mathematicians, most others wouldn’t either. The book describes the tortuous 
journey in developing a new mathematical theorem. What caught my attention was the format that the authour 
uses which is a combination of historical notes, collaborating with colleagues through emails, the impact 
on career and family life, all against a running commentary of both the frustration and joy of 
mathematical research. I was reminded of Richard Feynam’s Nobel Lecture on 
<a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1965/feynman-lecture.html" target="_blank">
The Development of the Space-Time View of Quantum Electrodynamics,</a> 
which describes the history of 
his research on the interaction of light and matter at the quantum level. Where as Feynman’s lecture 
describes the struggle involved in research, Cédric Villani’s books gives a greater insight by 
showing how the process is very fragmented. 
</p>

<p>
The BBC remains a great source for discovering art. For example during an edition of Radio 3’s Private 
Passions, a programme where a guest selects their favourite pieces of music ( mainly classical ), 
somebody  selected the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoAzpa1x7jU" target="_blank">Tears In The Rain </a> 
monologue from Blade Runner. I have watched Blade Runner many times but 
I hadn’t considered the end of the film a piece of poetry. But it is. A combination of the context, 
where the ‘replicant’ saved the hero, the music, and sound of the rain all combines to form a poetic effect. 
</p>

<p>
However, the poem that I discovered in 2015 was 
<a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Ni6FWTu_CIYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Dart+oswald&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Dart%20oswald&f=false"
target="_blank">Dart</a> by Alice Oswald. It is very difficult 
to write a long poem in a way that keeps the reader engaged. But using the structure of 
tracing the river Dart from its two sources East Dart and West Dart, which join at Dartmeet, 
and following it to the sea gives the poem a feeling of movement. Adding characters that lived 
and worked along the river, its geology and mythology adds layers to the poem that give it an incredible richness. 
But the use of words and metaphors move the reader into world sparkling with sound and images. 
This is a poem that I will return to many times.
</p>

Art continues to push into new mediums. A great example of using the medium of film is 
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0478337/" target="_blank">
Zindane: 21st Century Portrait by the artist</a> by the artist
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Gordon" target="_blank">Douglas Gordon</a>
Douglas Gordon. Football, and in particular the players, 
generate endless newspaper headlines. But behind all of the hype what is it like to be a football player? 
The video starts to answer the question and gives a fascinating insight into the background, thoughts 
and emotions of a great player. Maybe more artists should make documentaries?  
</p>

<p>
However, one evening I was listening to another Radio 3 favourite, Late Junction when 
a new piece of work, 
<a href="http://fadmagazine.com/2015/11/04/review-mark-leckey-dream-english-kid-1964-1999-ad/"
target="_blank">Dream English Kid, 1964 - 1999 AD</a> by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Leckey" target="_blank">Mark Leckey</a>
was played. I enjoyed the way that 
sounds and music were spliced together in a way that opens up thoughts about my own childhood. 
A bit of searching on the web found that he had produced 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dS2McPYzEE" target="_blank">Ferruci Made Me Hardcore.</a>
Initially I wasn’t sure what it meant, but like any piece of art, a few ‘viewings’ opened up a fascinating 
piece of work. The video is about the artists past, in particular the dance culture of his youth, 
starting with Northern soul. The combination of the clips and 
the sound track digs much deeper and asks questions about being a teenager when there is a 
struggle to be an individual and yet belonging to something bigger. However that 
bigger something never lasts long ( listen out for the bell tolling ). I am sure that there 
will be more art in the years ahead using social media. 
</p>

<p>
2015 has been another good year for discovering art in obscure places. I am looking forward 
to searching and finding more in 2016!
