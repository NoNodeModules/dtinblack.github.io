title: Using Pokémon Go To Pick Up Ideas
description: Describing the ‘process’ behind developing an idea.
---

<p>
It always happens in the morning shower. A thought emerges that clings onto another thought. 
An idea! It is a strange process – at least it is in my head !
</p>

<p>
Recently the media has been awash with the latest game to hit the streets, literally, 
<a href="www.pokemongo.com" target="_blank">Pokémon Go</a>.  
The smartphone game, is used to hunt down virtual Pokémon creatures in 
public areas, currently streets in major cities ( I’m sure that they will be everywhere soon ! ).  
Standing in the shower the thought that started to take hold: What if the object was not virtual 
but a toe stubbing solid ?
</p>

<p>
Another thought. I remembered reading a few years ago about an 
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/manchester/hi/people_and_places/newsid_8680000/8680310.stm" target="_blank">Oxfam charity shop</a>
in Manchester where 
the story of an object: teddy bear, book, ornament, had been recorded and using their app 
<a href="http://shelflife.oxfam.org.uk/" target="_blank">Shelflife</a>
the purchaser could listen to the history of the object. What if 
we take the technology behind Pokémon Go and use it on real objects overlaid with a virtual fiqure ? 
Mmmm. Problems 
start crowding in. How could the information about an object be gathered ? The virtual figures 
be developed ? … Wikipedia ! Use the collaborative approach behind Wikipedia to gather information 
about a subject but instead apply it to an object. Another problem starts to clamp 
around the idea ... trying to type text into a smartphone is not easy ( possibly type the 
information in at home on a desktop ? ).  Ah! another memory. I watched an 
<a href="http://events.technologyreview.com/emtech/digital/16/video/watch/andrew-ng-deep-learning/" target="_blank">interview</a>
with 
Andrew Ng, Chief Scientist, Baidu, talking about the exciting new developments in voice recognition technology. 
The technology could be used to input speech about an object - an ‘object editor’. Lets 
give it a cool name to get the marketing people excited … “talking object”,  “lifenet”, 
“iThing” (definitely avoid ‘e’ anything – it is so last decade ! ).
So there we have it – a freshly mined idea. Using a form of virtual technology to animate solid 
objects. 
</p>


<p>
Spinning the idea in my mind to see where it goes for possible applications. Objects such as 
statues, stately houses etc are great for tour guides, gardeners and historians, with lots 
of potential applications for education. Imagine going around a house picking up parts of 
a story from virtual people. Using the application with the Internet of Things to check on 
the health of a toaster ? Or providing guidance on how to fix a tricky plumbing problem with 
a virtual character pointing to the steps to be taken ?  Could it replace 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code" target="_blank">QR Codes</a> ( those 
funny square boxes that can sometimes be seen on an object ), or have more adventurous game such as 
developing 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocaching" target="_blank">Geocaching</a>
( following clues around the countryside ) ? ....
</p>

<p>
Now for the business question: how much is the idea worth? Checking the spot price for ideas 
it is somewhere between a chocolate biscuit and a cappuccino. The real work is taking an idea 
to market ( it took 
<a href="http://www.malaysiandigest.com/opinion/621984-pokemon-go-how-the-overnight-sensation-was-20-years-in-the-making.html" target="_blank">20 years for Pokémon Go to reach the streets</a>
)  therefore many twists and turns ahead.
</p>

<p>
Ideas can come at any time and place. But when they do - pump them full of imagination and explore !
I wonder what will happen when I switch on the shower tomorrow ?
