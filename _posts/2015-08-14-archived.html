title:  Healthcare Over The Horizon
description: A cup of coffee with the future of Healthcare.

<p>
Pushing open the door I was shaken awake with the smell of Eritrean coffee and popcorn.  
We arranged to meet at Street World, just off the high street, which was full of people 
having a quick breakfast and buried in their plastic paper catching up on the 2026 World 
Cup.  Standing in the queue my watch buzzed and a message flashed up saying that Toni was 
sitting by the window overlooking the street. As I looked over her watch had done the 
same and we waved. Any pictures that I had seen of her had not prepared me for how well 
she blended easily into coffee shop customers. I weaved my way around the tables and sat down. 
</p>

<p>
During the past couple of years we had exchanged messages about meeting up for an interview 
for this blog, and at last we had fixed a time. Toni headed up Breath, an organization that 
was using computer systems in a way that was revolutionising healthcare. Breath’s nomadic 
structure made it an atypical digital company, with a large contingent of volunteers. 
However, at the core of the company were Toni and her team of cofounders who managed the 
development of the open systems, that to quote the buzz on the latest social media tool 
Whisper ‘the human face of health care.’
</p>

<p>
Toni took a sip of the dark coffee and started:  “It was how the old books say … I had a 
problem that I knew I could fix.” She went on “I had to rush one of my children to Accident 
and Emergency and when I arrived we found chaos! People everywhere, machines rushing in and 
out of bays, police waiting to talk to patients and so on”. Toni took another sip of her 
coffee,  “My son was seen quickly and it turned out that it wasn’t serious … however I saw a 
where I could help”.  
</p>

<p>
Toni’s career had taken her though many companies including the famous Space Net which 
developed a global operating system for what used to be called the Internet of Things. 
She was now developing systems using the emerging science of psysystems. Psysystems 
integrate emotions into the control of computer systems so that systems and behaviours 
can be optimised. There had been many successes. One famous example was picking up on 
growing anger of people queuing and a psysystem put out a call for extra staff and 
switched on entertainment to reduce the people’s frustration.
</p>

<p>
Breath was taking psysystems a step further and applied the technology to organisations.  
In a complex organization, such as a hospital, there are many conflicts for resources for 
example between planned work and unplanned work. Planned work could include appointments 
for things like MRI scans, seeing consultants and so on, anything that could be scheduled. 
The unplanned is the unexpected, which in the case of a hospital is Accident and Emergency; 
nobody can predict what emergency is going to come through the door.  Working in this type 
of environment creates high emotions both for staff and patients therefore an ideal problem 
for psysystems to solve.
</p>

<p>
Toni went on “There had been a lots of work on optimising planned work. A good example from 
20th Century was just-in-time: matching resources to the point where they will be used”. Toni 
took another sip of coffee, “We tried a few ideas for the unplanned work.” She laughed, “Sometimes 
called just-in-case! where resources are stacked up just in case the unexpected happens, which 
can be a lot of stuff !” Breath developed a psysystem that managed the conflict by analysing 
the area that a hospital was located and then the system could plan resources to meet any 
unexpected demand. For example in a town or city we could work out what would be arriving 
at Accident and Emergency on a Friday and Saturday night. And then the psysystem would make 
sure that there were enough clinicians and medical resources available.  Toni went on “That 
was the easy bit … there was a bigger problem.”  
</p>

<p>
It came to light when Jake, one of Breath’s cofounders, was in hospital following a cycling 
accident. He noticed that the staff seemed to be spending lots of time at their desk busy 
and not enough with their patients. While recovering Jake developed a way to measure the 
amount of time spent with a patient and the time and costs for each patients stay in hospital. 
Breath took the idea and included it into their psysystem.  Toni went on ”But we had more to 
do, the system felt like another layer of management so we sat down with some hospital staff 
and worked on improving the psysystem. We wanted the staff to be in control. A number of 
things came out. Some of the additions to the software were easy. We development of an auto 
ordering and delivery system that was triggered by an emotion.” Toni laughed ”With the psysystem 
nurses were spending more time caring for their patients and less time chasing around trying to 
find bed pans !”  
</p>

<p>
Breath’s installed their first psysystem in a small hospital in the Midlands. Costs went down, 
staff were enjoying their work, and patient recovery time improved. “We have been given the 
green light” Toni went on “And our psysystem will be rolled out across the North West as the next phase.”
</p>

<p>
Asking about the future for Breath, Toni excitedly talked about using the latest advances in 
monitoring people’s health and how it could be integrated into psysytems.  Our coffee cups 
were empty and the interview was drawing to a close. I asked my final question: ”If there was 
one message about your experience with psysytems what would it be?” Toni replied “Psystems 
are a catalysts for change but will only work if they put people at their center.”
</p>

<p>
We said our good buys and promised to stay in contact. Pushing through the crowded steet, I 
wondered how many people knew that the person I had left in the coffee shop was working 
hard to make their lives better!
