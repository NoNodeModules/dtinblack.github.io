description: The best format, structure and style for a post. 
---

<p>
The <a href="http://dtinblack.github.io/2015/12/04/archived.html" target="_blank">previous 
series of posts</a> have been working through the underlying problems with the 
content of my blog.  I am frustrated with the quality of the posts: many of them are heavy 
and dull. During the recent posts I have identified a number of areas that have contributed 
to the problem including the type of language used and a lack of clarity about the target readership.  
This post will continue looking at the improvements that can be made by examining the 
structure, format, style and length of the posts.
</p>

<p>
In my blog I have experimented with different formats including letter, short story, and 
journalistic reporting. The different formats are an attempt to portray the subject under 
discussion in an interesting way and possibly different way. I will continue to experiment 
with formats.  Another aspect is the structure of the posts. Typically I start the post 
with an eye catching sentence ( I also use a strap line for the title ).  The post proceed 
with developing a case for the subject, followed by an explanation, summary and then closed 
with a sentence 
that summarises the content and links back to the opening sentence. In most cases this 
structure works but for different format such as a short story a different structure is 
required. Also, I have limited the number of words to 500 so that it should take the reader 
about three to four minutes to read.  However, with a limit of 500 words the posts can be 
too short for some of the subjects.
</p>

<p>
To help clarify the structure, style and word length of future posts I will, as in the previous posts in 
this series, use the target readership.  I have identified three broad categories of reader: 
those interested in applied mathematics as a career, other professions who are interested 
in the benefits of applied mathematics to their subject, and those who want to understand 
the impact of mathematics on society and culture.
</p>

<p>
For aspiring applied mathematician the style of writing has to have a sense of adventure 
and fun with and in a language aimed at a younger reader. They will have a word length of around 
500 to 1000 words. For other professions outside of mathematics, the style will argue the benefits 
of applied mathematics for their subject, with a word length of between 1000 to 1500 words. The style 
for last group, which are those interested in the social and cultural impact of applied 
mathematics on society, the format will be a short story, and the style will explore the 
emotional aspects from the impact of applied mathematics. Although I have identified three 
groups of reader there is a fourth group which is the wider public, where the style will be 
more critical in style with a word length of 500 words.
</p>

<p>
Now I have started to pin down the audience, style, format, structure and word length the 
final part in this series of posts will to be to pull all these elements together in a 
process, which is what the next post will discuss.
