title: Art for ( mental ) health&#39s sake
subtitle: Can Art improve mental health?
---

<p>Cycling can be tough going. Not only are the roads like tanks track, but during late autumn and winter the 
landscape is drained of all colour.  Add in wind, rain and freezing temperature and my mood can find 
reasons for being downbeat. However a few years ago I was lucky to attend David Hockney&#39s exhibition 
<a href="http://www.royalacademy.org.uk/exhibitions/hockney/" target="_blank">&#34The Bigger Picture&#34</a> 
where the artist painted a series of pictures about the Yorkshire landscape, 
in particular the Yorkshire Wolds. The pictures covered the changes during the changing seasons. They 
were full of colour and what I took form them was that even in the depths of winter there was colour 
and all I needed to do was to look harder. For me, colour is important and can have an impact on my 
mood. Now when I am out on the road I look for the colour even in the depths of winter and my mood 
definitely improves.</p> 

<p>Cycling is a time to reflect and put things in perspective, and during one trip I started to wonder about  
the impact of art on mental health. This is a difficult question. How would we define mental health? How 
do we define Art ? A quick search on Google produces a multitude of definitions. However, the best one 
I discovered is <a href="http://nhsinform.co.uk/mentalhealth" target="_blank">&#34Mental health</a>, or well bing, many definitions but include: life satisfaction, optimism, 
self esteem, mastery, and feeling in control, having a purpose in life and a sense of belonging and support&#34. 
In a similar way <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art" target="_blank">Art</a> could be defined as 
&#34Art can be characterised in terms on its reflection on life, 
expression, communication of emotions or other qualities.&#34 Both broad concepts but there is a hint that 
the two can work together.  So on the surface of a few definitions there seems to be a connection. Art is a 
creative activity that includes painting, music, literature and dance., and whether a producer or participant 
there seems to be a connection.</p> 

<p>There are some recognized uses of art to help with mental health, for example <a href="http://www.baat.org/art_therapy.html" 
 target="_blank">Art Therapy</a> which helps 
people recover from, or manage mental illness, and which should receive more support. However, is there 
a case for the broader public health ?  Further searching shows that no research on the link between 
mental health and art.  However, is there an opportunity for some research on the impact of Art on public 
health ?. As Wittgenstein wrote &#34People nowadays think that scientists exist to instruct them, poets, 
musicians, etc. to give them pleasure. The idea that <i>they have something to teach them &#45 </i> that does not 
occur to them&#34. 

<p>Maybe In a similar way that we have &#34five a day&#34 recommendations for fruit and vegetables then for 
mental health we could have: &#39sing a song a week&#39, &#39find five things that you didn&#39t notice before&#39,  
or &#39visit one art gallery a month&#39. There is more to cycling than turning pedals.</p>
