title: Career Advice From A Philosopher 
description: Wittgenstein’s career advice for an ex-student.
---

<p>
Recently the shredder has been working overtime chewing its way through the usual bills, bank statements and a few drawers worth of career documents:  CVs, pay slips, 
bonus letters and redundancy notices. Stopping frequently to let it cool down, a thought emerged about 
my career and the path it had taken - had it been worth it ?  Then I remembered the advice Wittgenstein gave to 
Maurice Drury, one of his ex-students.
</p> 

<p>
Wittgenstein met Maurice Drury in 1929 during his period as a philosophy lecturer at Cambridge University.  
Wittgenstein actively encouraged his students not to become professional philosophers, and in Drury’s case 
after graduation he became a psychiatrist. They met as often as circumstances allowed until Wittgenstein's 
death in 1951. 
</p>

<p>
During an evening walk Drury, who was a newly trained doctor, doubted his career path, 
because of his  “ignorance and clumsiness”. At the time Wittgenstein brushed off the conversation as 
Drury’s lack of experience.  Later that evening he wrote him a letter giving advice about his 
choice of career. After a section where he admonished Drury for "thinking about himself" when he should be 
"thinking about other", he wrote:
</p>

<p> 
“But not because being a doctor you may not go the wrong way, or go to the dogs, but because if you do, 
this has nothing to do with your choice of profession being a mistake. For what human being can say what 
would have been the right thing if this is the wrong one? You didn’t make a mistake because there was 
nothing at the time you knew or ought to have known that you overlooked. Only this one could have called 
making a mistake: and even if you had made a mistake in this sense, this would now be regarded as a datum 
as all other circumstances inside and outside which you can’t alter ( control ).”
</p>

<p>
Wittgenstein picked up on Drury’s use of the word “mistake” and questioned if he had used it correctly. 
The word 'mistake' is used in the context of knowing the action that should be taken to have not made a 
mistake. For example when we follow a route to visit a friend and arrive at the wrong house, we recognise 
that we had made a 'mistake' somewhere on the route. Taken a wrong turn.  
Therefore within the context of visiting the friend the word 'mistake' has a clear meaning. We made a 'mistake'.  
However, in the case of a career to use the word 'mistake' correctly would mean that we would 
have known what the correct career route was, and nobody knows that because we can’t read into the future. 
Drury made the best decisions he could within the circumstances at that time. 
</p>

<p>
Wittgenstein’s advice to Drury is not the standard career guidance that floods the book shops and web 
with 'Ten Steps To Success' type headings. Instead, he untangles the misuse of a word that leads to 
his frustration about his career choice.  As the shredder grinds through the last staff appraisal, 
Wittgenstein’s career advice has questioned whether I was asking the right question !
