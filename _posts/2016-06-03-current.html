<p>
In the opening scene of 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek_II:_The_Wrath_of_Khan" target="_blank">Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan</a>,
the familiar characters are in position on the deck of the USS Enterprise:  McCoy, Sulu, Uhura and Spock.  
All present except Kirk. There is a new captain in charge. 
Computer voices start to break out, frantic adjustment of controls and the ominous sight of Klingons 
start to fill the screens. The Enterprise is a sitting duck as the they come in for the kill. 
All are doomed !  Suddenly a door swishes open and Kirk ( now an Admiral ) walks in to bring 
what we now realise is a training 
exercise to an end. As the film progresses hints are given that Kirk was the only person to have beat 
the simulated test, and when he is facing what looks like his demise he is asked “How?”, 
Kirk replies “I reprogrammed the simulation so that it was possible to rescue the ship”. He went on 
“I changed the condition of the test”. Kirk changed the rules of the game.

Back here on Earth, the history of business turns on people who have changed the rules.  
There are many rule changers and my list includes 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Ford" target="_blank">Henry Ford’s</a> 
who developed the assembly line, which broke with the craft approach to produciion, and brought 
high value goods to the mass markets. The list would also include  
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Bezos" target="_blank">Jeff Bezos’</a> Amazon, 
which has radically changed the way that we shop, breaking with the tradition of the high street 
and bringing goods to our doorsteps.  
However, sometimes the most influential rule changers don’t require incredible advances in technology.  
In 1956 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcom_McLean" target="_blank">Malcolm McLean</a> 
developed a large standardized box and created the shipping container which  
radically changed the transportation of goods around the world. Containerisation is still growing–by 
11% a year. Many more names could be added: 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Carnegie" target="_blank"> Andrew Carnegie</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_D._Rockefeller" target="_blank"> John D. Rockefeller</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Kroc" target="_blank">Ray Kroc</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gates" target="_blank">Bill Gates</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs" target="_blank">Steve Jobs</a> and so on
( I'm sure that you have your own list which may include Scientists, Engineers, Artists, Musicians …).

But what is the makeup of a rule changer ? They seem to have some of the following characteristics:
<ul>
<li>Intuition - have a sense of the wider business environment and the rules that are holding 
it together. They can identify which rules need to be changed to improve the market for their goods 
and services.
</li> 
<li>Courage - an ability to stand up to the crowd and are not frightened to risk their own security 
to achieve their aims.
</li> 
<li>Drive - filled with indestructible determination to achieve the changes that they went to make.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
In Star Trek II, Kirk “received a commendation for original thinking” for reprograming the training 
simulator so that he could beat it. The people that change the rules of business have shown that they have the 
characteristics to 'reprogram' the business world. So what business rules are holding you back ? - how will you reprogram 
the rules so that you succeed ?
