title: The Ongoing Development Of The Book 
description: The ongoing development of the book.
---

<p>
Amongst the earliest books discovered is the  
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_Codex_%28Maya%29" target="_blank">Madrid Codex</a>
from around 900 AD; its content consists of 
almanacs and horoscopes that were used to help Maya priests in the performance of their rituals. 
Books have been used ever since to communicate ideas and influence the way that we live. There is 
something inherent in the human mind that seeks and develops new ideas but also has the desire to share 
with others. The book is the object that has proven to be the most enduring way of sharing those ideas.  
The breadth of a book’s content covers poets capturing the intensity of an emotion, the fiction writer 
exploring relationships, the scientist rationalising the world, and religious and political ideas guiding 
how we behave.

The structure and format of the book continues to develop and 2014 has been no exception. Amongst the 
crop of books that I have read during the year is Helen Macdonald’s  
<a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=B09UAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=h+is+for+hawk&hl=en&sa=X&ei=aWWgVOScB5H1asO5gKAC&ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=h%20is%20for%20hawk&f=false" target="_blank">H is for Hawk</a>.
She successfully blends different layers:  the history of Goshawk training, her own experience of training a Goshawk, 
memories of her dead father,, and the British countryside throughout the seasons. The structure of 
the book and the words tie these layers together which opened up the inner world of the author struggling 
with her grief through the taming of a hawk. I am sure I will reread this book several times in the 
years ahead.

In the world of science my preference is for books that get to the keys ideas quickly and Professor 
Denis Noble’s  
<a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Z9QaCmsSGf8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Music+Of+Life&hl=en&sa=X&ei=3WSgVKOGHI2raev5gTg&ved=0CCIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=The%20Music%20Of%20Life&f=false" target="_blank">The Music Of Life: Biology Beyond Genes</a>
is a fine example.  He argues for a new description 
of how we understand the relationship of genes with cells, tissues, organs and organ systems.  Using clear 
examples, including his own work on modeling the heart, I believe he has changed the way that we look at 
developing our understanding of biology. This book will remain a constant reference when reading about 
the latest developments in medical science.

My consumption of business books has been on a steady decline over the years because most of them are written 
like a report for senior management - dull and far too long. However, 
<a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=r9x-OXdzpPcC&dq=the+lean+startup&hl=en&sa=X&ei=eGKgVOCFK6KC7ga8gIHoDg&redir_esc=y" target="_blank">The Lean Startup: How Constant Innovation Creates Radically New Business</a>
by Eric Reis is a fresh approach to a difficult problem. In his book he  
addresses the problems that a start-up companies faces, in particular the how to manage the high 
level of uncertainty.  The book introduces new techniques in an exciting way to analyse the uncertainty and therefore 
improve the chances of success. This book is in prime position on my bookshelf. 
</p>

<p> 
Whether any of the books mentioned 
above will become central to our way of life similar to the Madrid Codex, only time will tell. 
However, the book remains the best object that we have to transmit our ideas and thoughts to the 
generations ahead.

Big thanks to anybody who has spent time reading this and my previous posts during 2014. All of them 
are attempts to write clearly about a subject that I have found interesting and I hope may have 
sparked your curiosity.
