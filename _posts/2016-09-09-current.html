The   
<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07rkh1v#play" target="_blank">
Shipping Forecast</a> squeezes its way between the programmes I usually listen to around 6 o'clock in the evening on the BBC. 
A steady and clear voice pushes my imagination out to a ship is clinging to the slap and wallop of 
a cold grey sea. On board, a captain is carefully recording the 
information and then looking out to the horizon, ponders their next decision.

The Shipping Forecast is been produced by 
<a href="http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/public/weather/marine-shipping-forecast" target="_blank">The 
Meterological Office</a>
for 
<a href="http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/learning/weather-and-history/shipping-forecast-history target="_blank">
over 90 years.
</a>It is broadcast at four times throughout the day: 5:20 am, 12.01 pm, 5.45 pm and 00.48 am. 
It usually starts with the area called Viking and then works it way clockwise 
around the UK covering the remaining 
<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/coast_and_sea/shipping_forecast" target="_blank">areas</a>. The names
of Tyne, Dogger, Lundy, Faroes and so are folded into the English language, their  
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shipping_Forecast" target="_blank">history</a>marking out 
Britain's maritime history. 
</p>

<p>
The forecast is full of precise terms that have to be decoded. For example, the terms 'veering' and 
'backing' refer to the change in wind direction. When a wind is veering it is changing in a clockwise
direction, whereas backing is anti-clockwise direction. Also, 'variable' means winds of less than force 4 that are changing 
by 90 degrees and 'Cyclonic' means there will be considerable change ( see 
<a href="http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/guide/weather/marine/glossary" target="_blank">Shipping Forecast Terminology</a>
for further explanations of the words ).

<p>
Although the words used in The Shipping Forecast don't have any apparent rhyme, I will leave them in the hands 
of Seamus Heaney:

Dogger, Rockall, Malin, Irish Sea:
Green, swift upsurges, North Atlantic flux
Conjured by that strong gale-warning voice,
Collapse into a sibilant penumbra.
Midnight and closedown. Sirens of the tundra,
Of eel-road, seal-road, keel-road, whale-road, raise
Their wind-compounded keen behind the baize
And drive the trawlers to the lee of Wicklow.
L’Etoile, Le Guillemot, La Belle Hélène
Nursed their bright names this morning in the bay
That toiled like mortar. It was marvellous
And actual, I said out loud, ‘A haven,’
The word deepening, clearing, like the sky
Elsewhere on Minches, Cromarty, The Faroes.
