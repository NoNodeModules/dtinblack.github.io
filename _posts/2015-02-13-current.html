title:  Bayes Theorem - Where Is It ?  
description: First steps in finding a clear description of Bayes Theorem.
---

<p>
Like bubbles of air that burst through the surface of a pond in a warm summers day, 
Bayes Theorem pops up across the many pools that make up the media. Newspaper articles, 
blogs and scientific magazines try valiantly to describe the impact of Bayes Theorem on 
everyday life with a few terms from mathematics tentatively pushed around.  
</p>

<p>
Reading through the media it seems that Bayes Theorem is applied to a diverse range of areas: 
assessing skill in computer games, developing medical devices, filtering out spam including the 
now legendary bank account in Nigeria, search patterns for finding lost planes, assessing which 
advert will pop up when using your favourite search engine, and playing a crucial role in the 
“war on terrorisim”. Bayes Theorem is linked with Artificial Intelligence, including how machines 
can learn,  a situation that  provoked 
<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-30290540" target="_blank">Prof. Stephen Hawkins</a>
to pronounce dire warnings about 
the future of humanity, or the lack of it ! Bayes Theorem seems to have crept into our way of 
life.  But what is it ?
</p>


<p>
Trawling across the web gathers up articles with titles such as: 
<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/life-and-physics/2014/sep/28/belief-bias-and-bayes" target="_blank">"Belief, bias and Bayes"</a>,
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/30/science/the-odds-continually-updated.html?_r=0" target="_blank">"The Odds, Continually Updated"</a>,
and 
<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2003/mar/20/research.science" target="_blank">Tomb with a grave view</a>.
However, the articles soon diverge 
onto the controversies between “Bayesians and Frequentists” or through around  the mysterious term: 
“Inverse Probability”.  Where there are claims of simple explanations many of the diagrams look like 
a map of a battle field:  full of squiggles and strange symbols, or descriptions using boxes with coloured 
balls, spinning coins or the chances of developing  cancer. Against this background,  
subsequent posts will attempt to give a clearer picture of Bayes Theorem, and hopefully clear away some 
of the dense fog that surrounds it.

<p>
Information about the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Bayes" target="_blank">Rev. Thomas Bayes</a>
is vague, but what we know is that he was born sometime in 
1701 and was probably born in Hertfordshire. He studied Theology and Logic and Edinburgh University 
as apart of his ordination to become a Nonconformist Minister. He took up his ministry at the Moint 
Sion Chapel in Tunbridge Wells until 1752.  He died 1761 and was buried in Moorgate, London.  
</p>


<p>
The Rev. Bayes had a keen interest in mathematics and published two papers in his lifetime. He was 
elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1742 probably based on one of the papers, which was a 
logical defense of the mathematical techniques developed by Newton. In his later years he took a deeper interest in probability, which may have been 
influenced by a book he read on chance in gambling.  
</p>

<p>
It is unclear when Bayes wrote the unpublished paper that would include the theorem that his name 
would becomme firmly attached too, but it was found after his death by his friend Richard Price, who 
sent it to the Royal Society and where it was read in 1763.

<p>
What was the problem Bayes was trying to solve ? Why was it important ? Why does it have such a grip on our lives ?
The next post will start to uncover the some answers.
