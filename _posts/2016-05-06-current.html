<p>
To gain greater insight into journalism, Notebook successfully completed the on-line course 
<a href="https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/introduction-to-journalism" target="_blank">Introduction to Journalism</a> 
on Friday 6th May 2016.
</p>


<p>
The course, 

was developed by 
<a href="https://www.strath.ac.uk/staff/higginsmichaeldr/" target_="_blank">Dr Michael Higgins</a>, 
Senior Lecture in Journalism at the University of Strathclyde, and a team of internationally-renowned 
scholars and journalism practitioners and gives you a behind-the-scenes look at the professional 
world of Journalism. More specifically, Dr Higgins describes what to expect from the course, 
“you are taught how to 
recognise and research news stories, to write news features intelligently,  to examine how 
politics impacts on the journalistic process and will find out how investigative journalism 
can be allowed for more robust reporting”. 
</p>
 
<p>
The course lasts six weeks and is delivered free by the  
<a href="https://www.futurelearn.com/" target="_blank">Future Learn</a>'s
Massive Online Open Access ( 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course" target="_blank">
MOOC </a> ) platform. 
The teaching material is delivered through video based lectures and interviews, supported by 
text and examples of the different types of news articles. Learning is  reinforced by written 
assignments which are assessed by fellow students, and multiple choice quizzes.

Notebook’s impression of the course was “I had been frustrated by what I felt was poor journalism, 
the media, in particular social media, seemed to be full of celebreties and personalities rather than hard
facts and insightful reporting. When I saw this course I was curious to 
find out more. It has helped me to sort out the good from bad journalism. I have a better 
understanding of the relationship between journalists and politicians. But now appreciate the 
courage, determination and skills of investigative journalism. An unexpected aspect from the course 
was being introduced to different writing styles and formats which should eventually improve my blog”

<p>
The growth in MOOCs doubled between 2014 and 2015 reaching 
<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/research-and-markets-idUSnBw126155a+100+BSW20160112" target="_blank">35 Million students worldwide</a>
and is 
set to continue growing at a rate of nearly 50% annualy for the next few years. They continue to increase
access to education to people all around the world. For Notebook the experience, “gave flexible access 
to insights into journalism, which has changed my attitude to journalists and their work, and I enjoyed every minute !”
