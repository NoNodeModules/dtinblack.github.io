title: Improving Posts – Who wants to read it ?   
description: Who is the audience for the blog ? 
---

<p>
In <a href="http://dtinblack.github.io/2015/11/06/archived.html" target="_blank">previous posts</a> 
I identified a number of challenges in achieving my aim for this blog of 
bringing subjects that I find interesting to a wider audience.  However a major problem 
with the challenge was balance:  between emotion and technical language, and depth of 
technical description against brevity.  To help find the correct balance between the competing 
elements this post will identify the target audience(s) for the blog.

<p>
The first step is to be clear about the core subject that interests me most, and  looking 
back over my posts, it is the application of mathematics. But before you start 
surfing to another web site let me try and convince you to keep reading. Applying mathematics 
to a wide variety of problems develops many skills that can be applied to other areas:  
problem solving, analytical skills, investigative skills, communication and creativity.
The last one, creativity might come as a shock.  The majority of people who 
brush against mathematics remember school and the endless applications of formulae. However, 
applying mathematics to problems often requires new and novel ways of looking at a problem, 
in other words creativity ! These skills can be applied to many different areas. For example 
in writing a short story all of the skills can be applied: solving the many problems involved 
in developing a theme into characters and a plot. If the story is set in a particular period, 
or a specific genre, then a lot of research is required to get the detail of the context correct.  
Analytical skills are used at the editing stage: what passages are working, what needs to be added 
etc.  which can be just as creative as thinking up the story to begin with. These are the same skills 
that are involved in applying mathematics that can be applied on other activities.

The next step is clarifying the range of the subject. Mathematics is applied in science, 
engineering and technology, and increasingly through computer technology, with algorithms 
and data it is being applied to many more aspects of everyday life.  Wherever a pattern 
can be detected, and it can be quantified, then mathematics can probably be applied. However, 
there are limits, which Wittgenstein’s ideas on meaning and language will help to ensure that 
they are not broken.

Now we are clear about the subject and its range, who is the audience?
The first audience will be people who are thinking about a career in mathematics 
and who need to find out more about the subject. The style of writing will need to instill 
a sense of excitement – a sense of adventure!  Another possible audience is those from 
different professions who are trying to understand what mathematics means for their 
activities e.g. scientists, engineers, doctors, football players, etc. The style of writing 
for this audience will be descriptive and demonstrate the benefits of mathematics. The final 
group is those who are interested in the impact of mathematics on society and culture. The 
writing will be more orientated towards literature.

In the next post we will explore different formats and structures that could be used to 
reach the audiences described above.
