title: The NHS and unplanned vs planned demand  
description: Impact of unplanned admissions in the NHS.

<p>
While in the Accident and Emergency ( A&E |) of our local hospital with my son, whose nosebleed wouldn’t 
stop, an incident caught my attention. A doctor started searching through a cupboard located 
by the main desk: she was frantically searching through overflowing drawers but didn’t find 
what she was looking for. A few phone calls and twenty minutes later a porter arrived with a 
package that she took and then disappeared behind the curtains. What caught my attention 
was the amount of time spent in finding the item. It was a situation that I had seen in lots of 
other industries.
</p>

<p>
During the hours that we waited to make sure that my son’s nosebleed had stopped, I started 
to think about the problem that I had witnessed.  What would be the best way to analyse it 
in a way that a possible solution could be developed? The NHS is a very complex organization:  
it covers many different aspects of health care and it provides support every minute of the 
day and night, year after year.  Therefore ensuring that one of the many millions ( if not 
billions ! ) of items are available for treating a patient must be a major challenge. 
</p>

<p>
As the clock slowly moved on I played with an idea. Making sure that items are available 
to complete a piece of work has two aspects that need to be balanced: the item must be available 
when required to ensure that the activity is completed on time, but the cost of buying, 
storing and delivering the item should be minimised. 
<p>

<p>
There are broadly two approaches to managing items ( or ‘goods’ in the terminology of Economists ) 
: Just-in-time and Just-in-case. Just-in-time was developed in the 1960s and 1970s for manufacturing. 
Its aim was to reduce  inventory costs in a way that items are received when needed and large stores
are not required. The key activities to successful Just-in-time management is estimating the demand 
and subsequent planning. I suspect this is very difficult in the NHS due to the nature of its activities. 
</p>

<p>
Just-in-case is something which we may be more familiar with.  In our household,  if I look at 
the amount of ‘stuff’ we have stashed away in cupboards and freezers ‘just in case’ we have 
family and friends dropping in. Just-in-case is an acceptable approach as long as the ‘cases’ 
are within realistic bounds of possibility ( if imagination is defining the ‘cases’ then the 
situation starts to slip out of control hence our extremely full freezer ! ). However, the heart 
of the problem to ensuring that items are available in the NHS and yet minimizing waste is 
planning for the demand. 
</p>

<p>
My sons nose bleed had stopped for two hours but the nurses wanted to make sure that everything 
was okay before we were allowed home. Therefore sitting by his bed I continued with the problem. 
It struck me that activities in a hospital that could be planned would include consultations, 
tests and planned operations and therefore this should fall under the heading of Just-in-time. 
The other situation is what brought us to A&E - an emergency - which neither the hospital 
Therefore our case and many of the other demands on a hospital are unplanned and falls into 
the Just-in-case. The more unplanned demand then the more Just-in-case is needed and therefore 
the potential for waste and increased cost. 
</p>

<p>
As the clock moved slowly on I used my smartphone to pull together a few numbers for 
NHS England. In 2015 there were approximately 20 million A&E attendances ( unplanned demand 
by my definition). This is against a background of approximately 85 million Outpatients ( 
which I am assuming comes roughly under the heading of planned demand ). A very crude calculation 
gives 23% unplanned ( e.g.  20 /85 Million * 100 ). In manufacturing 5% unplanned would be considered 
world class but it can be typically be less ( numbers are difficult to get ). A number of conclusions 
can be drawn:
</p>

<p>
1 ) I don’t understand the numbers that I found on the web and therefore my simple calculation 
is pointing me in the wrong direction ( after publishing this post I will continuing to dig into the data ! ).
</p>

<p>
2 ) If the numbers used above are remotely correct then the NHS have a long way to go to catch 
up with the best in manufacturing.
</p>

<p>
3 ) Or the NHS are managing a situation that is not similar to manufacturing and therefore a 
Just-in-time ( or similar methodologies from manufacturing ) can not be applied. This conclusion 
makes sense because people are individuals and not objects. Therefore new solutions need to 
be found.
</p>

<p>
So what can be done ? How much of the unplanned demand could be planned. There are a number 
of potential areas that could be explored: 
</p>

<p>
1 ) Reduce the demand on A&E ( and therefore the unplanned element of demand )  by using GP’s more. 
Although some research has been carried out on increasing access to GPs there is no conclusive 
evidence so far. Also, under this heading could be increased access to information for self-diagnosis 
via phone or the web.
</p>

<p>
2 ) Patterns of A&E attendance could be statistically characterized, which could be used to 
predict the demand and therefore reduce unplanned element. Other patterns maybe determined 
for example ‘after surgery complications’ might be age related and therefore resources could 
be planned.
</p>

<p>
3 ) Medium to long-term predictions on hospital demand could be explored using 
social data. For example looking for a link between   
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/english-indices-of-deprivation-2015" 
target="_blank">Index of Multiple Deprivation</a> and the local hospital 
may produce the capability to predict the demand on the services that it provides could be made.
</p>

<p>
As we drove home I was struck by the professionalism and kindness shown to both my son and 
myself by the hospital staff against the background of a very demanding environment.  
I  wondered if the thoughts 
gathered during our time in A&E would help them in some aspects of their work. More to follow…
