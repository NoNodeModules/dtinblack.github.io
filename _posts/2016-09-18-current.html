title: Design, Dieter Rams and the Spoon
description: Dieter Rams design principles applied to the spoon.
---

<p>
Solving a design problem usually requires a trail and error approach involving
many attempts at a solution. Each attempt gets closer to a specification which
has been set by the demands of a customer. However, most designs are a compromise between its
function, aesthetics and cost. The compromise always raises the question as
to how 'good' the solution to the design problem actually is.
</p>

<p>
Faced with the same problem
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieter_Rams" target="_blank">
Dieter Rams</a>, in the late 70's, asked himself if his designs
were good designs. In answering his question he developed ten important principles
for what could be considered a good design.
</p>

<p>To explore the design principles I have taken what may appear to be the trivial example
of a spoon.  However, it is an object that has been used for many centuries
and its evolution is a good test of its continuing use. The design of the spoon
consists of a bowl and handle and is mainly used to prepare
,serve and eat food. The earliest known spoons were used by the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoon" target="_blank">ancient Greeks</a>
and were composed of ivory, flint, slate or wood and possibly used in religious ceremonies.
Today we are never far away from a spoon.
</p>

<p>
Taking the design of a spoon and assessing it against Rams' design principles
we get:
</p>


<p>
<b>Good design is innovative</b>
<i> - The possibilities for innovation are not, by any means,
exhausted. Technological development is always offering new opportunities for innovative
design. But innovative design always develops in tandem with innovative technology, and can never
be an end in itself.</i>
</p>

<p>There have been many innovations in materials over the years which have found their
way into the design of a spoon. In recent times plastic is used for disposable spoons
which can be found on ice cream tubs. These innovations have brought advances in the use
of the spoon e.g. wooden spoons are more ecologically friendly. Maybe in the future
sensing devices may be included in a spoon to help monitor peoples eating habits or
ensuring people with dementia have eaten.</p>

<p>
<b>Good design makes a product useful</b>
<i> - A product is bought to be used. It has to satisfy certain criteria, not only functional,
but also psychological and aesthetic. Good design emphasis the usefulness of a product
whilst disregarding anything that could possibly detract from it.</i>
</p>

<p>A spoon is integral to our way of life and is taken for granted - until we can't
find one ! Also, we use a spoon without thinking about its use - when was the last
time you concentrated on using a spoon when eating sticky
toffee pudding ?</p>

<p>
<b>Good design is aesthetic</b>
<i> - The aesthetic quality of a product is integral to its usefulness because products
we use every
day affect our person and our well-being. But only well-executed objects can be
beautiful.</i>
</p>

<p>The early history of the spoon was seen as a social status but because of
mass manufacturing it has become common place. If a spoon becomes over decorated then
it can be unbalanced, or heavy, which can distract in its use.</p>

<p>
<b>Good design makes a product understandable</b>
<i> - It clarifies the product’s structure. Better still, it can make the product
talk. At best, it is self-explanatory.</i>
</p>

<p>The design of a spoon - the bowl and handle - is clear in its use.
</p>

<p>
<b>Good design is unobtrusive</b>
<i> - Products fulfilling a purpose are like tools. They are neither decorative
objects nor works of art.
Their design should therefore be both neutral and restrained, to leave room for
the user’s self-expression.</i>
</p>

<p>A spoon can go beyond its normal use but it is only if the user should desire.
For example
it can be used to demonstrate the principles of levers, or used as a pointer,
the handle can be used as a bicycle tyre lever or to propel a
pea through the air ! The key point is that it is down to the user to express
its use.</p>

<p>
<b>Good design is honest</b>
<i> - It does not make a product more innovative, powerful or valuable than it really is.
It does not attempt to manipulate the consumer with promises that cannot be kept.</i>
</p>

<p>The shape of design of a spoon does not go beyond its function.
It can't drill a hole or hammer in a nail or cut cloth.</p>

<p>
<b>Good design is long-lasting</b>
<i> - It avoids being fashionable and therefore never appears antiquated. Unlike fashionable design,
it lasts many years – even in today’s throwaway society.</i>
</p>

<p>Although the ornamental design of a spoon has changed over the centuries to reflect
its social status its underlying shape has stayed the same.</p>

<p>
<b>Good design is thorough down to the last detail</b>
<i> - Nothing must be arbitrary or left to chance. Care and accuracy in the design
process show respect towards the user.</i>
</p>

<p>The design of a spoon has no additional frills. It sticks to its function.</p>

<p>
<b>Good design is environmentally-friendly</b>
<i> - Design makes an important contribution to the preservation of the environment. It
conserves resources and minimize physical and visual pollution throughout the
lifecycle of the product.
</i>
</p>

<p>Most of the metal used in manufacturing a spoon can be recycled. Similarly for wooden
spoons supplied with ice cream tubs.</p>

<p>Rams design principles highlight features of the spoon that have stood the test
of time and its is an example of a 'good' design. I am sure that applied to
similar objects.
</p>

<p>However an interesting question about Rams design principles is whether they can
be applied to a service or process. If not maybe there is scope for a new set of
design principles with the same flavour as Dieter Rams'.
