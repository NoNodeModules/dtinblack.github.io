title: Shaping Ideas Into Products
description: Questions to help develop an idea into a business opportunity.
---
<p>
Having a great idea for a business opportunity is only the first of many before before it finds its 
way to a paying customer. Over the years I gathered the following series of questions that have helped
me develop business ideas.They may help you with developing your own business opportunities.
</p>

<p>
<b>What is the phrase that pays ?</b> – The discipline of describing an opportunity 
in a short phrase strips away the peripheral aspects and 
distil an opportunity to its essence. Your idea could be sumarised into an 
<a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2007-06-18/the-perfect-elevator-pitchbusinessweek-business-news-stock-market-and-financial-advice"
target="_blank">The Elevator Pitch</a> for when you need to sell your idea quickly.
</p>

<p>
<b>What pain are you solving for the customer ?</b> – Opportunities to solve a customer’s 
pain are often more robust than those that address less pressing desires, therefore clearly identify 
how the idea is going to help.
</p>

<p>
<b>Does the opportunity already exist ?</b> - Check that the idea is not already a product. My experience
is that for every 100 ideas that I have then 99 are already products. 
</p>

<p>
<b>What has changed to give rise to the opportunity ?</b> – You need to point to 
specific changes in the competitive, technical or regulatory environment to explain the 
origin of your opportunity. You need to be driven more than a simple desire to be 
an entrepreneur.   
</p>

<p>
<b>How perfect is the opprortunity ?</b> – Innovation not perfection ! – can you learn quickly 
from mistakes and correct quickly ? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Why is the opportunity still here ?</b> – If it’s such a good opportunity, why hasn’t somebody 
else done it ? Maybe its too early ?
</p> 
 
<p>
<b>What is the feedback from others ?</b> - It is important to get feedback from as many people as possible.
But be careful. The feedback needs to be honest and constructive. One approach  
developed by Rob Fitzgerald’s called
<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/xamde/summary-of-the-mom-test" target="_blank">The Mom Test</a>.  
describes a good 
way to ask potential customers about an idea in a way that gets constructive feedback.
Similarly when you are asked for feedback think carefully what is being asked and how you will reply. 
When I give feedback on an idea I use the

for feedback approach: what is good about the opportunity, what isn’t so good, and what can be done to 
make the idea better.
</p>

<p><b>Would it pass the 
<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006vq92" target="_blank">BBC's Dragons Den</a> test?</b> - Watching 
a few episodes of the programme will help to guage the type of questions that will be coming your way when looking for 
investment and therefore how prepared you should be.
For example, do you have enough information about the opportunities business potential to complete the risk / reward calculation.
Also, can you supply any credibility to potential cash flow ? </p> 

<p>
<b>How big is the market ?</b> – It is often difficult to forecast the market for a new 
product or service with precision. However back-of-the-envelope calculations can provide 
a rudimentary estimate of market size and provide a check on overblown ambitions. 
</p>

<p>
<b>If the opportunity involves new technology can it be developed in a ‘garage’ ?</b> – Can the key 
elements of 
the technology be developed under your own control e.g. software development, mathematics, 
hardware, etc, in other words can something be cobbled together with whatever is at hand ?
A good approach to minimising startup costs is the

<p>
There are many more questions that will help develop your idea into a business opportunity but the ones
above should help with the first few steps.
