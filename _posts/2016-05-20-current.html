title: Can Mathematics Make Us Happy ?
description: Using the emotional aspects of mathematics to improve its use.

<p>
The state of mathematics in the UK periodically bubbles to the top of the news headlines with: 
<a href="http://www.nationalnumeracy.org.uk/what-issue" target="_blank">"Numeracy skills have got worse, not better"</a>,
<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-32608772" target="_blank">"Asia tops biggest global school rankings"</a>, and
<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2517834/Britains-stagnating-schools-UK-teenagers-slip-world-league-maths-science-reading.html#ixzz495OXvinf" target="_blank" >"Britain's stagnating schools: UK teenagers slip down world league in maths, science and reading"</a>.
The media parades experts to cast their opinion on the state of the subject and what needs to be done ( 
which usually requires more money ). 
Journalists bounce the subject around: 
<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/18/maths-more-pointless-than-latin-british-pupils-china" target="_blank">"For Britain's pupils, maths is even more pointless than Latin"</a>, 
<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/11/maths-isnt-problem-curriculum-lacking-imagination" target="_blank">"Maths isn’t the problem - the way it’s taught is"</a>, and
<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/feb/23/maths-teaching-revolution-needed-conrad-wolfram" target="_blank">"The UK needs a revolution in the way maths is taught. Here's why…"</a>.
Government ministers respond with tweaks to the mathematics curriculum fully expecting a swift implementation.  
Then the topic sinks back down to the lower depths of the public consciousness. Until the next survey sparks 
another heated debate.

<p>
Part of the problem with skill in mathematics is failing to recognise that mathematics is a language. 
Instead of a sentences full of nouns and verbs that allows us to navigate through life, mathematics 
consists of equations full of additions, subtractions, multiplication and divisions that are used 
to quantify the amount of money in our banks, the cheapest deals and the number of days left before our 
holidays. Therefore like any other language, its use is linked to how important it is to us.  
</p>

<p>
The reality is that  outside the professional use of mathematics ( for example in science, engineering and 
technology ) there is no real call for skills in 
mathematics. Although our lives are dominated by numbers: price of milk, temperature at the beach, 
time of the next train, there is a need rarely analyse and manipulate the numbers. Then there is
the dreaded ‘x’ and ‘y’.  Picking up  
five apples from the supermarket shelves which are round, feel firm , look and smell delicious. 
But when we try to 
represent the number of apples by the abstract letter ‘x’ a fog of confusion sets in. Abstraction is a challenge to 
most people. However, when it is understood mathematical symbols can unlock a new set of skills that can have many applications, for 
example working out compound interest ( important in calculating the amount of money required for a 
happy retirement).

So what can be done ?

<p>
Ronal Reagan is quoted as saying that 
<a href="http://www.talkativeman.com/make-connections-with-people-like-reagan/" target="_blank">
“Persuade through reason, motivate through emotions”</a>. There are enough 
reasons for that should persuade people that mathematics is important: managing household budgets, improved job 
opportunities, transfereable skills, planning for the future, improved critical thinking and so on. But 
the big challenge is to demonstrate the emotional aspects of mathematics ( big challenge as most peoples 
view is that mathematicians sit in towers pouring out pages with strange symbols or worse remember their
experience at school !). Therefore the challenge ( and plea ) 
to mathematics teachers, authors, experts, 
governments and industry is to increase the motivation to learn and use mathematics by bringing out the 
emotional aspects subject - it could be fun !
