many years ago and at the time I wasn’t sure whether 
I enjoyed it or not. However, it was different enough to stay at the back of my memory. Over 
the past few weeks I was thinking about the language of Science, Engineering, Mathematics and 
Technology ( 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_Technology,_Engineering,_and_Mathematics"
target="_blank">STEM</a> 
 ) and how it could be integrated into literature, when <i>Xorandor</i> popped back 
into memory.

Christine Brooke-Rose began her career as an author with a series of conventional books during the 
1950’s. Then, in 1964 following a serious illness, she published her first experimental novel

a “race reversal” novel in which white people suffer from a mysterious radiation related illness. 
She continued to publish experimental books up until her autobiographical

published in 2006.

<i>Xorandor</i> was published in 1986 and is the second book in a set of novels grouped together as the 
Intercom Quartet which are concerned with media and communications technology. They include:

<i>Xorandor</i> is the story of two precocious children, in their pre-teens, called Zip and 
Zab. While sitting on a beach in Cornwall they discover that the large stone that they are sitting 
on is a computer. They call the computer Xorandor and it feeds on radioactive waste. 
Xorandor produces off-springs that find their way around the world 
creating many problems for the authorities which are often very funny.  
</p>

<p>
The book is a record of Zip and Zab's version of events and its format is a series of transcripts that they 
have recorded on their computer. Along with their recordings are taped discussions which were 
overheard between adults in authority about what to do with Xorandor and its offspring’s. Also, 
there are transcripts of discussions between Zip and Zab and Xorandor, which are in a programming 
language similar to BASIC.
</p>

<p>
The first few pages were difficult to read until I started to appreciate that the story is from
Zip and Zab’s viewpoint. They are piecing together their story from from the different discourse 
styles in a way that describes the events as they saw them. There is an interesting exploration 
on the accuracy of memory and how to structure of a story. 
Their language includes slang based on computer terminology and nicknames that children would typically use.
Also, the STEM terminology is used in a way that doesn't sidetrack the story into too much detail.
Although, at times, the slang can grate a bit and the character development is 
limited it doesn’t distract from the story but reminds the reader that it is from a child’s 
point of view.  Also, the taped sessions between the adults lack the pace of real dialogue 
which can slow the story down.  
</p>

<p>
Critics often accused Christine Brooke-Rose of being ‘difficult’ to read. But against a 
background of fragmented media, in particular social media, the style used in <i>Xorandor</i> feels very 
refreshing and a book that I enjoyed.  It is a book worth reading and asks important questions 
about the media and communications technology that is relevant for today.
