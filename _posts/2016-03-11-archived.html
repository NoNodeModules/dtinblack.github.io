description: Sharing learning from H&S incidents through storytelling.

‘Stop, stop!’ a voice clawed through his memory and he stopped. The pump was as large as a 
fridge and he had to take it apart. But there was something he needed to remember. Then it 
came to him. Something happened in a workshop on the other side of the town.  
Word had flooded through the pubs, shops and workshops about Jim Rodgers who was stripping 
a pump without a sling to hold the large metal disk called a flange. He was good at stripping 
pumps. He had been doing it for many years, and he was strong enough to hold any of the parts 
without a sling. However, that day was different. Whether it was a hangover from  the night 
before, worrying about his daughter’s school report, or the arrival of a new boss. He never 
said. The flange slipped out of his hand and sliced of his toes. He walked with a limp ever 
since. Jim’s story was firmly in his mind as he went to find a sling.

Health and Safety ( H&S ) incidents can happen in any organization, institution or business and can 
range from a cut finger to the loss of life. When an H&S incident happens an investigation 
team ( if it is a serious incident then various agencies such as the Health and Safety Executive
and Police will be included in 
the investigation ) is set up to establish what can be done to ensure that the incident doesn’t 
happen again. However, the mechanisms to update people on the learning from the incident is 
unclear. Although procedures maybe updated and followed up with specific H&S initiatives it 
is difficult to measure the effectiveness of the take up of the new learning ( during a few 
phone calls I recently made it became clear that there is no way of measuring the effectiveness 
of sharing the learning).

The story at the beginning of this post demonstrates the importance of a story in passing information 
within and between groups. The power of a good story is the emotional content; it is what we 
remember about it. Although
<a href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/asbestos/videos/jean-morgan.htm" target="_blank"> 
videos</a> 
are available where people discuss the impact of a H&S incident the written word can give 
a greater context which could connect with more people.

I would put forward the idea that if the learning from an incident could be wrapped up in 
a story in a way that the people reading it would remember it, then it could change their behaviours 
and ways of working.

If a well know author such as:  
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilary_Mantel" target="_blank">Hilary Mantel</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colm_T%C3%B3ib%C3%ADn" target="_blank">Colm Tóibín</a>
or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Hall_(writer)" target="_blank">Sarah Hall</a> 
wrote 
short stories that included the learning points from an H&S incident then it would not only attract 
the attention of the people who need to read but would would ensure that the quality of the story 
was good enough to get the learning over. The short stories could be distributed using the 
web, ebook, apps etc. which could be monitored to check how many times they were read and therefore give some 
insight into the uptake of the learning.

Stories are an import part of the way that we live: they entertain, explore relationships and 
illuminate life. Could they save people from injury or death ?
