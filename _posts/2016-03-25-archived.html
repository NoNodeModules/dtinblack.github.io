title: Can Big Data be Thickened ?

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data" target="_blank">

Big Data </a>

is the big news. Many businesses, universities and other organisations are investing 
large amounts of money into developing technology that exploits the many pieces of data that 
we generate from our lives. Recently I came across the term 
<a href="https://www.brandwatch.com/2014/04/what-is-thick-data-and-why-should-you-use-it/" target="_blank">
Thick Data </a>
which has been coined to cover a deeper look at the context within which data is gathered.  Of course 
behind every new buzzword they’re a series of concepts that have been around for sometime. 
However, that doesn’t mean that they are out of date, on the contrary the may be relevant for today.
</p>

<p>
Trying to find an agreed definition for Thick Data has proved impossible. However summing and averaging 
the various definitions found on the web, I have arrived at: Thick Data is data gathered about our 
behavior and underlying motivations. Traditionally the data has been gathered through surveys, questionnaires, 
focus groups, interviews, journals, videos and so on and gathered and interpreted by analysed by 
ethnographers and anthropologists ( social scientists ?). Compared to the people who collect and 
analyse Big Data who often sit in IT functions with analytical degrees,  there is a large gap between 
the two groups.

<p>
But how could Big Data be thickened ? What capability would computer technology have to achieve 
to add context to data ?
</p>

<p>
In Clifford Geertz’ paper 
<a href="http://philpapers.org/archive/GEETTD.pdf" target="_blank"> 
Thick Description: Toward an Interpretive Theory of Culture</a>
he describes a situation challenge that computer technology would have to overcome to thicken data 
( if you are interested in anthropology and ethnography then the whole paper is worth reading ): 
“… two boys boys rapidly contracting the eyelids of their right eyelids of their eyes. In one, 
this is an involuntary twitch, the other a conspiratorial signal to a friend. The two movements 
are, as movements, identical, from an I-am-a-camera, “phenomomenalistic” observation of them alone, 
one could not tell which was twitch and which was wink. Yet the difference, however 
unphotographicable, between twitch and a wink is vast, as anyone unfortunate enough to have had 
the first taken for the second knows. The winker is communicating, and indeed in a precise way: 
(1) deliberately, (2) to someone in particular, (3) impart a particular message, (4) according 
to socially established code, and (5) without of the cognizance of the rest of the company.”  
</p>


<p>
Current computer technology can capture and analysis eye movement, and possibly distinguish a wink from 
normal eyelid movement. Also, computer technology has developed to a point where emotions 
can be captured ( see the 
<a href="http://www.myfeel.co/" target="_blank">Feel Wrist Band</a> ) and levels of motivation 
can be measured ( usually measured against set goals ). However, gathering data to analyse the social 
context, as described in the passage above, has a long way to go.
</p>

<p>
Therefore the challenge for computer technologists, and social scientists is: what developments 
in computer technology are required to gather thick data to enable a greater insight into our 
behaviours and motivations?
