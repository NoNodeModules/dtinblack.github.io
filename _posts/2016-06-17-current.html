title: Phew ! Another Year Over !
description: Challenges of writing a blog for a second year. 
---

<p>
The second year of writing my blog has been like the second day of a five day cycling trip. 
Very hard going. The first day of cycling is full of excitement and legs are pumped with 
adrenaline; mile after mile breezes past. But on the second day each turn of 
the pedals aches and the climbing up a hill sucks the last drop of air out of my lungs. I won’t 
describe the weather! Similarly with my blog. After the first year of writing my blog, which 
was great fun, this year I hit the ‘wall’.  My ideas for topics dried up, and when I managed 
to get something down on a page it felt I was probably going to torture the reader.  I will 
always battle with grammar but over the last year it felt that I was loosing. And then there 
is the pressure of work; family commitments and illness, which added to a head wind, that 
made each post feel like an impossible turn of the pedal.

Towards the end of this year I stood back from the struggle and tried to do something to 
revive my enthusiasm for writing and my blog. First I joined 
<a href="https://www.futurelearn.com/" target="_blank">Future Learn</a>'s
free on-line course
<a href="https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/introduction-to-journalism" target="_blank">Introduction to Journalism</a> 
where I learned about the different styles of journalism 
which included feature and opinion writing. The new ideas and approaches have refreshed my 
imagination.

<p>
Another area I addressed was grammar. I was unable to answer some 
<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/apr/29/grammar-test-english-primary-schools-headteachers" target="_blank">test questions</a> for primary school pupils 
so it was it was time to get back to basics. I bought an excellent book by Sue McMillan, called 
<a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Easy_Peasy_English.html?id=0hPmngEACAAJ&redir_esc=y" target="_blank">Easy-Peasy English</a>
which is aimed at primary school children, and I have never looked back 
( as I type this post John Sutherland’s
<a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1wuiCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT1&dq=John+Sutherland+grammar&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi7oaOH06nNAhUkAsAKHVuND-UQ6AEIJTAA#v=onepage&q=John%20Sutherland%20grammar&f=false" target="_blank">How Good Is Your Grammar ?</a> 
popular book is on its way ! ) 
</p>

<p>
Leaning for other bloggers is always a good way to pick up on a few tips but I prefer tightly written text.  
Sadly lots of blogs tend to cover many web pages and by I have paged down several times I have lost interest. 
However, I started to read editorials and 
gained a lot of insights about balancing an argument in a few paragraphs, as well as writing 
in an engaging style. Also, reading a wider range of books has helped. My top book of the 
year so far is Truman Capote’s 
<a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dRkzaee6Fv0C&redir_esc=y" target="_blank">In Cold Blood</a>, which details the 1959 murders of four members 
of the Herbert Clutter family in the small farming community of  
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holcomb,_Kansas" target="_blank">Holcomb, Kansas</a>. 
The story is built up through a series of interviews, which makes it feel journalistic and real. 
Finally, I learned a lot from squeezing the meaning out of a few words in a tweet that tries to 
reach as wide an audience.

At the end of the second day of cycling, there is a sigh of relief over a few beers. Knowing that 
the worst is over and muscles know what is ahead and the journey starts to feel achievable. 
With my blog I feel that a turning point has been reached, and I am looking forward to mixing 
my imagination with a tighter writing style – it is looking like fun!
