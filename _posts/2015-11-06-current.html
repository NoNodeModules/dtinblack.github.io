title: Developing Posts – Language  
description: The challenge of explaining a technical subject.
---

<p>
The purpose of this blog is to write clearly about subjects that I find interesting; in a 
way that reaches a wide audience. However at the heart of this challenge is developing a 
writing style that balances two styles: literature with factual, story telling with equations.
</p>


<p>
In the <a href="http://dtinblack.github.io/2015/10/23/archived.html" target="_blank">previous post</a> 
I discussed the struggle in finding a balance between 
a style of writing that has an emotional content and a language that can contain 
specialised words e.g. partial differential equations, bureaucratic theory, language-games,  etc.  
to the general reader. However, the problem goes much deeper. 
</p>

<p>
In Stephen Toulmin’s 
<a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mPLenAEACAAJ&dq=toulmin+the+philosophy+of+science&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CB0Q6AEwAGoVChMIzvzfgaf7yAIVwkIUCh2NEwBh" target="_blank">
<i>The Philosophy Of Science</i></a>,  he describes the dichotomy between the specialized 
and general reader: “one can distinguish between an account of a theory in the new terminology – in 
‘participants language’ – and an account in which the new terminology is not used but described – 
an account in the ‘onlookers language’. The key difference is between the person who uses a particular 
technical language as part of their everyday work, and somebody has heard about the terminology 
but doesn't understand what it means.
</p>

<p>
Toulmin goes on to describe another aspect of the problem: “For a layman wants to be told about 
the theories of science in a language he can understand; and he also wants to be told about them 
briefly, ‘in a nutshell’ These two demands are in conflict. For a major virtue of the language 
of the sciences is its conciseness.” A good example of this problem is describing change. Most 
people are aware of change whether it is the seasons, weather, interest rates, jobs etc. However, 
when a mathematician, or a physicist, describes change they use a much narrower, more specilaised 
definition such as “an abstract representation of how a physical quantity changes over time” or 
more specifically in the language of mathematics: d f(x) / dt (This is a good example of one of  
Wittgenstein's key ideas that a word gets its meaning from its use. In other words, the meaning 
of d f(x) / dt only gets its meaning by solving differential equations ).

<p>
Therefore, the challenge of narrowing the gap between two different types of reader is more 
complex. Not only does a balance between an emotional and descriptive style need to be found, 
but within the descriptive style another balance between an ‘onlooker’, 
and the language used by the scientist, technologist, engineer or mathematician.  
How can all of these competing demands be satisfied ?. In the next post we will 
start to identify the target audience for the posts, which will help to find that balance.
