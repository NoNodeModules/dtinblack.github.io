title:  One Year On ...
description: Learnings from a year of blogging.
---

<p>
It has been a year since I started this blog and therefore I felt it maybe a good 
time to reflect on how well it has been going.
</p>

<p>
My original aim was three fold:  improve my writing skills so that I can clearly describe 
a topic that interested me and hopefully make it interesting to others, develop a way of 
working to make sure that I routinely published a post, and to write my own software to 
learn about blogging software. 
</p>

<p>
So how has it gone?
</p>

<p>
I successfully managed to get a post out every two weeks, which against a background of: 
family and business commitments, illness, lack of ideas, and holidays, it is an achievement!  
Over the year I learned to draft a post ahead of the deadline so that it gives me enough 
time to tweak and edit the content. Which in my case can take about 10 to 15 drafts.
</p>

<p>
Content?  Looking back at the earliest posts then I would probably re-write most of them 
and in particular improve the grammar ( a recurrent weakness ). Grammar is important because 
it helps to clearly express an idea or topic. Also, the topics I covered were very varied 
and therefore at times trying to squeeze some into 500 words was a push. Even when I split 
a topic over a series of posts it didn’t work as successfully as I hoped – it became to 
disjointed and repetitive ( I was trying to follow the approach by the master of episodic 
writing Charles Dickens but fell a long long way short ).  Finally, I built the blogging 
software using 
<a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" _target="blank">Jekyll</a>, 
and wrote software to format and navigate the blog, in particular
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design" _target="blank"> 
Responsive Web Design</a>
( where the format changes depending upon the device e.g. mobile, 
tablet or desktop ). Using 
<a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/" _target="blank">Google Analytics</a> 
helped me to understand how the blog was being 
read. In summary, lots to improve but I have enjoyed the process and I am now in a position 
where if I am not developing a new post on a regular basis then I feel guilty!  
</p>

<p>
What next?
</p>

<p>
Continue to improve the grammar of the posts. Work harder on the tone of the posts making them 
less formal therefore making them more engaging for the reader ( what writers call finding their voice). 
If a topic is greater than 500 words then increase the length of the post to 1000 words but no longer 
and include any background material that maybe of interest to the reader in an attached file. 
Improve feedback on the content of the posts by targeting them at individuals and organisations 
and asking for advice on improvements. Developing the design of the blogging software 
to improve the navigation and possibly add email notification.
</p>

<p>
Finally, but most importantly, a big thanks to those people who have read any of my posts – the fact 
that one person has read one of my posts gives me great encouragement to keep going for another year.
