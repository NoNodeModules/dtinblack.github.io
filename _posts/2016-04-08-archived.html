title: Refreshing Language with Poetry
description: How poetry can refresh language.
---

<p>
Some days it is harder than most to sit down to write a post. Although I have a list of 
interesting subjects which I have gathered over the years, it is still a struggle to find 
inspiration.  The problem for me is the words; trying to combine them in 
a way that describes what I am trying to say clearly and in a way that is interesting. 
It is a constant battle. When I hit these periods I turn to the poets for inspiration.  
</p>

<p>
Although poetry may seem a strange source for inspiration for writing about mainly technical 
subjects, the poets skill with words show what can be done to stir the imagination and create emotion all 
within a few lines. 
</p>

<p>
There are many great poets to select from but the following selections are amongst my favourites 
and I hope will give insight into the power of words when combined in original ways. 
</p>

<p>
The first fragment selection is by 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Larkin" target="_blank">Philip Larkin</a> 
who can tell a story in a few lines. No better example of this 
than the opening to probably his most famous poem:
</p>


<p>
<div class="poemwrapper">
<h1><a href="http://www.poetryarchive.org/poem/whitsun-weddings" target="_blank">The Whitsun Weddings</a></h1>
<h2>by Philip Larkin</h2>
<p>That Whitsun, I was late getting away: <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not till about<br />
One-twenty on the sunlit Saturday<br />
Did my three-quarters-empty train pull out,<br />
All windows down, all cushions hot, all sense <br />  
Of being in a hurry gone. We ran<br />
Behind the backs of houses, crossed a street<br />
Of blinding windscreens, smelt the fish-dock; thence <br/>  
The river’s level drifting breadth began,<br />
Where sky and Lincolnshire and water meet.</p>
</div>

</p>

<p>
Within a few lines we are sitting in the stifling heat on the train looking at the scenery 
passing by the window. This could have easily been the start of a novel or the first 
paragraph in a piece of a short story.
<p>

<p>
Another example is the winner of the 
<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/mar/25/national-poetry-competition-paul-adrian" target="_blank">
2010 National Poetry Competition</a>, which was won by 
Paul Adrian. The poem is taking what seems a scientific topic, in 
this case the physics of particles but turning it into something more meaningful:
</p>

<p>
<div class="poemwrapper">

<h1>Robin In Flight</h1>
<h2>by Paul Adrian</h2>


<p>Let’s imagine for a second that the robin<br/> 
is not a contained entity moving at speed<br/> 
through space, but that it is a living change,<br/> 
unmaking and remaking itself over and over<br/> 
by sheer unconscious will, and that<br/> 
if we were to slow down the film enough<br/> 
we would see a flying ball of chaos,<br/> 
flicking particles like Othello counters,<br/> 
air turning to beak in front just as tail transforms to air behind,<br/> 
a living being flinging its changes at a still universe.</p>

<p>This would require infinite alignments. Each molecule<br/> 
privy to the code of its possible settings,<br/> 
the capacity of a blade of grass to become<br/> 
the shadow of a falling apple by pure force
of the tree’s instinct. Every speck of world with the potential<br/> 
to become stone, dog’s breath, light twisted through glass,<br/> 
filth under fingernails, the skin’s bend at the bullet’s<br/> 
nudge the moment before impact,<br/> 
the thought of a robin in flight,<br/> 
the thought of the thought of a robin in flight.</p>

</div>
</p>

<p>
I could fill many web pages with similar examples showing how poets use words to shape 
what they are trying to say in a way that is economically but with great impact.
</p>

<p>
Back to normal for the next post, but hopefully in better control of a few of 
those slippery words!
