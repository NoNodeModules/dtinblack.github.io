title:  Public Speaking Lessons From A Prison 
description: Lessons about public speaking from BB King. 
---

<p>
I find public speaking difficult. No matter how much effort I put in behind the scenes I 
still get very nervous and my speech is like a Dalek on steroids. 
</p>

<p>
YouTube is a good source for learning about public speaking from great speakers, in particular 
the impressive way they “work the audience”. However, I stumbled across a clip with the great 
bluesman BB King playing a gig in 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sing_Sing" _target="blank">Sing Sing</a>
, one of New York’s state maximum security prison, 
and his performance followed the key elements of making a good public speech.
</p>

<p>
Conditions in New York state prisons had been deteriorating during the late sixties and early 
seventies reaching its lowest point in 1971 when there was a riot at 
<a href="http://digitalcommons.buffalostate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&context=exposition" _target="blank">
Attica</a> 
prison and 43 people were killed. Against this background David Hoffman, a film and documentary maker, 
had been working with prisoners in Sing Sing, when in 1972 he organized a concert, which 
included BB King and Joan Baez.

<p>
BB King started his section with How Blue Can You Get ? – please watch the following:

<p>
You can’t fail to be drawn into the performance. So what can be learned ?  
</p>

<p>
First know your audience, and why they are attending, in this case the gig ( or in our case a 
meeting, presentation, conference etc ). In other words what are their expectations. Of course 
in BB’s case most of the audience didn’t want to be in prison; therefore turning up for the gig 
they would have been looking for entertainment to relieve the tedium. 
</p>

<p>
Next is to catch the attention of the audience, and then hold it.  BB starts his section with a few 
jokes that makes a link between himself and the audience. He then quietly plays a solo on his beloved 
guitar 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucille_%28guitar%29" _target="blank">
Lucille</a> that settles the audience down and draws their attention to the stage.
The song that he plays has a direct contact with the audience; it touches on life outside of prison. 
He then pulls the audience further into the performance, by play acting the role of the woman in the song.  
</p>

<p>
The last point that can be taken from the video clip is to continue pulling the audience into the 
performance. The song builds up in three stages with a ‘punch line’ at each stage. This continues 
to draw in the audience step by step. Any comedian couldn’t have improved on the delivery of the final punch 
line, and the resulting audience reaction is a riot of cheering and laughter. 
</p>

<p>
In summary: know your audience – why are they there and what is there expectations, grab their attention 
and hold onto it, and finally build up their interest until the final few lines are memorable.  BB King 
had refined his showmanship over many years, which gives the final point. Although public speaking is 
difficult it is important to keep going; presenting different material to a wide range of audiences in different 
venues, and grow in confidence by learning from each event.
