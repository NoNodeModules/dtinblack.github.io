title:  When Jon Met Malala 
description: The liberation that education brings.  
---

<p>
One of my favourite American comedians is Jon Stewart who with The Daily Show lambasted rival TV network 
commentators, celebrities and politicians. Therefore, I was intrigued when I recently came across an 
interview with Malala Yousafzai, who was awarded the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize.  
The interviee was not his normal target therefore I was curious to see how he would he would manage it ?
</p>

<p>
During the interview Jon asked questions that teased out two important subjects: Human desire for 
education and the importance of education in overcoming terrorism ( and other forms of repression ). 
</p>

<p>
Jon: “Where did your love of education come from ?”
</p>

<p>
Malala: "We are human beings, and this is the part of human nature we don’t learn the importance of 
anything until it is snatched from our hands. When in Pakistan we were stopped from going to school at 
that time I realized that education is very important. Education is the power for women and that is why 
the terrorists are afraid of education, they do not want women to get education because women will become 
more power.”
</p>

<p>
Education can take many forms, not only the systematic approach taken by the education system e.g. primary, 
secondary, university but new forms such as 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course" _target="blank">
Massive Online Open Courses ( MOOCs )</a>  
and 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_learning" _target="blank">Adaptive Learning</a> which are 
delivered via the web and has increased the access to learning.
However, there is another part that education 
plays and it is social change. As a hardened socialist recently reminded me the roots of the Labour Movement 
was education. Education was seen as a way to move the working class out of poverty and into the middles class. 
</p>

<p>
Towards the end of the interview Jon asked how the American people and in Malala's reply further important aspects of 
education emerged:
</p>

<p>
Malala: “I think that the people of America, the United States, they truly support peace, and they say that 
they must not fight against war with war, dialogue is the best way and we must find a solution for it. In my 
opinion the solution that would work to fight all these wars and all these problems that people are facing 
is only education” and she continued  “… going to school is not only learning about different subjects it 
teaches you about communication, it teaches how to live a life, it teaches about history, it teaches about 
how science is working, other than that you learn about equality because students are provided the same 
benches, they sit equally, it shows us equality, it teaches students how to accept each other together 
how to accept each others language, each others religion, it teaches justice and respect, it teaches us 
how to live together”
</p>

<p>
At the end of the interview the comedian was clearly moved and inspired by a very brave girl from 
the Swat Valley in Pakistan. The content of his interview with Malala is a reminder to us all about the critical role of 
education in making a better world.
