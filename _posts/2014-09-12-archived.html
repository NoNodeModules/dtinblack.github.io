title: The Crisp Packet Challenge  
description: Forecasting health conditions

<p>
Every Friday at around 9 o'clock the fridge door is swung open and bottles of beer are popped open, 
wine glasses filled and crisps are poured into large bowls that are surrounded with a selection of 
dips. It is family ritual. However we can't claim originality. It started many years ago after 
watching a documentary about the adventures of  
<a href="http://www.chayblyth.com/" target="_blank">Sir Chey Blythe.</a>
No mater where he was in the world, 
between 6 and 7 in the evening, he and the crew would stop whatever they were doing and drink a few 
glasses of whiskey. It was a moment in a dangerous and hectic life when they could stop, take in the 
fantastic scenery, and put life back into some sort of perspective. What was good for Sir Chey is good 
for us. Our ritual has developed into a period when we can come together as a family, catch up, and steady 
the ship after the usual stormy week.

However, during the last few years like a head win that has sprung out of nowhere the 'H' word started to 
creep into our family ritual.  Gusts of : 'Is this good for our health ?','What impact is this doing to our 
health ?' and 'Shouldn't we have less crisps?'. There is no doubt that our slug of beer-wine-crisps-dips is 
the top side of the recommended daily intake of calories but like a weather beaten sea dog I face resolutely 
into the ‘H’ead wind.

Medical progress is accelerating, and exciting new discoveries are announced every week. The dropping 
price of technology has allowed the development of "fitness bands" and other wearable sensors that can 
measure vital signs. All this and the vast amount of medical information available on the web have 
contributed to improving health. But one of the biggest impacts on health remains lifestyle, and in 
particular diet.  In the media there seems to be what can be considered as  generalisations. Statements 
such as  &#34;Eat a balanced diet&#34; – but what is the balance ?, Or the see sawing between &#34;red wine is 
okay&#34;, &#34;red win is not okay&#34; or &#34;too much butter is bad for you&#34;, &#34;but some butter is okay&#34; 
and so it goes on.

However it seems to be difficult, if not impossible, to accurately predict an individual's health from 
their diet, and more importantly on how long we will live. Therefore I have developed The Crisp Bag 
Challenge, which is, if I eat another bag of crisps during our family get together how many hours, 
minutes or even seconds will it reduce my life span? Of course I offer no prizes. However, the winner, 
or winners, can glow in the knowledge that you will have resolved at least one family dispute around a 
fridge. In the meantime we will still be looking forward to our Friday night ‘Happy Hour’, imaging Sir 
Chey Blyth, glass in hand, out on the open seas.
