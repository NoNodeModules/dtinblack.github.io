title: Improving Posts – The Aggregate of Marginal Gains    
description: A process to produce better posts.  
---

<p>
In the previous series of posts I have been working through the areas of my writing that 
need to improve. This is the final post in the series where I will describe a process 
that I have developed to help with writing future posts.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Brailsford" target="_blank">Sir David Brailsford,</a> 
the mastermind behind Great British Cycling Team’s great success, developed 
a philosophy called ‘the aggregate of marginal gains’. The approach comes from the idea 
that if you break down everything you could think of that goes into riding a bike, and 
then improved it by 1%, you will get a significant increase when you put them all together. 
In a similar way if I take all of the different stages of producing a post and continually 
improve each aspect then hopefully the quality of the posts will improve. 
</p>

<p>
The first step in my process is gathering ideas. There are any number of sources for ideas:  
newspapers, magazines, journals, radio, TV, tweets, conversations, the web etc. Other sources 
that can generate ideas are:  art exhibitions, museums, sport and theatre. But the key point 
at this stage in the process is to jot them down with a few lines about why they are interesting. 
</p>

<p>
The next stage is more difficult. Selecting a subject to write about. However, as discussed 
in previous posts, I will match the subject to the target audience. Also, I will estimate the amount 
of time that it will take to produce the post and how it will fit into the regularly posting 
– the heart beat – of the blog.
</p>

<p>
Once the subject and audience have been identified then a period of time will be spent 
researching the subject: has anybody else written about it ?, what do I know about the 
it ?, what type of language will I use ? what is the level of understanding about the subject 
that the audience will have ? and so on.
</p>

<p>
Once the research phase has been completed then the creative phase can begin. Ideas will be 
explored about the best way to write the post. During this phase other medium may be explored 
e.g. YouTube etc.
</p>

<p>
Once I have worked through the above stages, then it is time to write. Writing involves 
the nearly infinite sequence: draft-edit-draft-edit-draft … until something acceptable has 
been reached. Once this has been achieved then there will be a cooling off period where the 
draft post is put on the shelf for a few days.  Then I will return to the 
draft post with a fresh pair of eyes for the final edit. 
</p>

<p>
It is crucial to get feedback on the post. Therefore it will be sent to potential publishers 
with the aim of getting feedback on areas that I can improve my writing. The feedback will 
also be used to revise aspects of the process described above ( in the spirit of the ‘aggregated 
of marginal gains’ ).
</p>

<p>
Phew! It has taken a few posts to get to this point but I have found a number of areas where 
I can improve my blog. Lets see what happens!
