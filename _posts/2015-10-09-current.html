title: The Proof Of Mathematics
description: Mathematical proofs and why they are important. 
---

<p>
Mention mathematics to a group of people and most of them will glance at the floor, turn, and leave 
mumbling about something else to do. Mention mathematical proof to those that are left and 
it is guaranteed to clear the room. And yet the principles behind mathematical proof: 
clear assumptions, connecting steps in an argument to draw conclusions that can give new 
insights into problem, are amongst the one of the key activities that shape the world that 
we live in.  The following will try and demonstrate my claim.
</p>

<p>
To explore the power of a mathematical proof I will examine one developed over 2000 years 
ago, which involves prime numbers.  A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no 
divisor. For example 7 is a prime number because 1 or itself can only divide it. However, 
8 is not a prime number because 2 and 4 can divide it.  The prime numbers or primes are the 
numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7,11,13,17,19, 23, 29, which cannot be resolved into smaller factors. 
Thus 37 and 317 are prime. The primes are the material out of which all numbers are built 
up by multiplication: thus 666 = 2 ⋅ 3⋅ 3⋅37. A natural question arises when computing primes 
– what is the largest prime? 
</p>

<p>
One approach in answering the question is to calculate primes with pen and paper. But after 
a few pages, and probably many miscalculations, fatigue would set it and the paper bin would be full! 
How about using a computer?  The current largest prime is 17,425,170 digits ( which would fill 
over 5,500 pages or 20 books ) and has taken over 75 years of computer technology development ! 
Is there a different approach?

<p>
Over 2000 years ago Euclid developed the following mathematical proof:
</p>

<p>
1 ) Assume that you have found the largest prime Q.
</p>

<p>
2 ) Let P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>2</sub>, …P<sub>n</sub> ( e.g. P<sub>1</sub> = 2, P<sub>2</sub> = 3, P<sub>3</sub> = 5 .. ) 
be a list of all of the primes up to Q. 
</p>

<p>
3 ) Consider a new number N = 1 + P<sub>1</sub>*P<sub>2</sub>*P<sub>3</sub>… *Q. 
</p>

<p>
4 ) Evidently N is not divisible by P<sub>1</sub>, since since on division the remainder is 1.
</p>

<p>
5 )  Similarly N is not divisible by any of the other primes. 
</p>

<p>
6 ) Therefore N is either itself a prime, or if a multiple of other primes, it is divisible by 
some prime not in our list. 
</p>

<p>
7 ) Therefore Q is not the largest prime; therefore we can conclude that the prime numbers are infinite.
</p>

<p>
In the space of a few lines Euclid demonstrated that there is no largest prime.
</p>

Being skilled in the principles of mathematical proofs: starting from clear assumptions, building up a 
coherent argument which leads to a sound conclusion is a powerful technique.  With the increasing 
influence of social media and an already overloaded media we live in a dense fog of information. 
Maybe using an approach similar to mathematical proofs could cut through the mist and give a 
clearer view of what is importan?
