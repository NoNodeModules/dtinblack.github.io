title:  Product Development By Dots
description: Product development based on Steve Jobs’ dots.

“You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. 
So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future.”

When I came across this quote I wasn’t sure what it meant. Although I had a few vague 
notions what it could be alluding to this post will try and develop some ideas around 
“dots” and how they could be “connected”. 
</p>

<p>
Given Jobs’ background I am assuming that “dots” are related to product development and 
how they are connected is to construct an object, in his case an Apple product but could 
be anything from a cup to an aeroplane.
</p>

<p>
Of course a dot could be anything that we define, but let’s aim for the functions of an 
object.  But that just moves the idea onto another vague concept. So we need to apply 
some concrete to give it shape. Objects ranging from something complex as a car to 
the handle on a door carries out a function. One transports us to a destination the other 
either opens or shuts a door. Therefore a dot does something. 
</p>

<p>
Let’s add another aspect to a dot, its aesthetic appeal: something that connects to our 
emotions. When we pick up a perfectly round object then it is not only aesthetically 
appealing it can have an emotional connection e.g. trigger good memories. So we can give 
our dot two  dimensions: function,  what it does,  and its aesthetic appeal, what product 
developers call form.
</p>

<p>
How can dots be joined together? Looking at the different functions on the laptop that I 
am currently typing on has tens of functions from the keys that I press 
to the screen that folds down. Yet they are connected in such a way that as I type this 
post I am not aware of all 
of the different functions, they don’t distract, I just use them to write this post. It 
looks distintive with subtle features such as the colour, size, rounded corners etc 
which make it feel good to use.
</p> 

<p>
Now, maybe what Jobs is alluding to in the “we can only connect by looking backwards” 
statement is that there are certain dots that overtime have become an integral part of 
our lives ( look around your kitchen and you will see many objects that have in principle 
looked the same but have changed subtly over the years e.g. kettle ).  In other words 
history has established the dots that are integral to our life and should be the basis 
for the new connections.
</p>

<p>
So how could dots be reconnected ? They should be connected in a way that creates a new 
object that functions in a way that solves a customers problem, and have an aesthetic 
appeal that both says what it does and has an emotional connection. Also, the balance 
between the new and old connections should make the unfamiliar familiar.
</p> 

<p>
If the above was in Steve Jobs mind when he produced the quote then when it all comes 
together in an object it should be, quoting W. B. Yeats, “ … comes right with a click 
of a closing box”
