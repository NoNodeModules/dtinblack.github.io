title: Building Confidence with a Success Network
description: Outline of how confidence can be built using a network of support.
---

<p>
At the beginning of the week I received an email from 
<a href="https://www.ageofnoretirement.org/" target="_blank">The Age Of No Retirement</a>  
whose aim is “to create a world where age does not matter”. They were alerting me to their latest
<a href="https://confidence.ideas.ageofnoretirement.org/Page/Home" target="_blank">Challenge</a> 
which is about developing products and service to help people build their confidence. A lack of confidence 
is seen as “single most limiting factor in being able to work and develop our careers”.  
What triggered a number of thoughts is the difficulty in pinning down the word 'confidence'. 
</p>

<p>
Searching the web for information about building confidence produces many results with  
titles such as "ten ways to increase your confidence" and links to books that claim easy 
steps to improving confidence with endorsements such as "this book has changed my life". The 
large and diverse level of discussion is a sign that there is confusion in what 'confidence' 
means.
</p>

<p>
Confidence is important. It pervades all aspects of life from public speaking or 
baking bread. We gain a sense of confidence when we see ourselves mastering skills 
and achieving goals that matter in those skills whether it is starting a new business or 
writing that long promised novel. Confidence gives us the courage to persist in the face of 
setbacks and gives us a sense of well-being, as well as developing our social status.
</p>

<p>
There is active research on the relationship between confidence and: 
<a href="http://www.kingsfund.org.uk/sites/files/kf/field/field_document/motivation-confidence-health-behavious-kicking-bad-habits-supporting-papers-anna-dixon.pdf" target="_blank">motivation</a>; 
<a href="https://www.quora.com/Is-self-confidence-an-emotion-or-a-behavior" target="_blank">emotions</a>;
theories such as 
<a href="http://www.hrdpress.com/site/html/includes/items/RSCEI.html target="_blank"> Emotional Intelligence</a>
and  
<a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Cognitive-behavioural-therapy/Pages/Introduction.aspx" target="_blank">Cognitive Behavioural Theory</a> 
and increasing insights from 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioural_sciences" target="_blank">Behavioural Science</a>, 
but it is work in progress. 
</p>

<p>
However, based on my experience in developing my own confidence the best help that I have received 
is a combination of good training and emotional support. 
The challenge is to identify the best training and the correct level of support 
for the person who needs to build their confidence in particular skill. Some initial 
thoughts are:
</p>

<p>
<div class="orderedlist">
<ol>
  <li>Develop a profile for the person that identifies the skills that they are 
  confident in and the skills where they need to improve. Most of us have a range of skills 
  with different levels of confidence.</li>
  <li>Match the people with strong confidence in specific skills with those who need to 
  improve particular skills. Because there will not be a an ideal match ( we all have different 
  levels of confidence in various skills ) a network of people would be formed to help the person build 
  confidence in particular skills – a Success Network ! 
</li>
  <li>The person's Success Network would provides advice and recommendations for training 
  course, web sites, books, MOOCs, Adaptive Learning etc. that would help develop the new levels of confidence
  for a particular skill. The Success Network would also provides emotional support and encouragement 
  to help the person reach the level of confidence that they want to reach. The person's interaction with their Support 
  Network would ideally be face-to-face ( if geographically close maybe over a coffee ? ) but could be via Skype, 
  FaceTime etc. or a telephone call ( email would be discouraged !). </li>
</ol>
</div>
</p>

<p>
The Success Network would be web based to connect the person with their Support Network. The web 
based system would also be used to exchange views and develop additional products and services 
for the Success Network. 
</p>

<p>
Building confidence is an on-going challenge for most of us, and hopefully, the thoughts and 
ideas described above may be of help.
