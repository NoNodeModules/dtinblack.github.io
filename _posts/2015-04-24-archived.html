title:  Bayes Theorem Part 4 - A Working Description  
description: Description of Bayes Theorem.

<p>
In the previous three posts we covered: the problems of trying to find a clear description of 
Bayes Theorem
<a href="http://dtinblack.github.io/2015/02/13/archived.html" _ target="_blank">on the web</a>, 
the idea behind 
<a href="http://dtinblack.github.io/2015/03/13/archived.html" _target="blank">probabilities</a>, 
and the important case of  
<a href="http://dtinblack.github.io/2015/04/10/archived.html" _target="blank">
conditional probability.</a> 
We are now going to take the last step towards a clearer description of the Bayes Theorem.
</p>

<p>
To illustrate the idea behind Bayes Theorem letâ€™s use the example of two rival football clubs: Red FC 
and Blue United who have played each other for 20 seasons ( a total of 40 games ).  The results are that 
Red FC have won 15 out of the last 40 games therefore the probability of winning the next game is 15 / 40 or 
37.5 %  ( good betting odds ? ). However, news arrives that the next game will be played at home. 
Digging further into previous results we find:
</p>

<center>

<div class="post_table">

<table>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th>Home</th>		
    <th>Away</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Red FC Win</td>
    <td>12</td>		
    <td>3</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Red FC Draw</td>
    <td>3</td>		
    <td>2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Red FC Lose</td>
    <td>7</td>		
    <td>13</td>
  </tr>
</table>

</div>

</center>

</p>

<p>
The results show that Red FC has a better performance at home. 
Bayes Theorem can be used to update the original probability of 37.5% with the additional information about the team's 
home and away performance. In this case the probability of 
Red FC winning when playing at home is ( using mathematical symbols where P() means probability ):
</p>

<p>
<center>
P( Red FC win | home ) = P(home | Red FC win ) * P(Red FC win ) / P( home ), 
</center>
</p>

<p>
From the information shown in the table :
<p>
P( home | Red FC win ) = 12 / 15,
</p>
<p>
P( Red FC win ) = 15 / 40,
</p>
<p>
P( home ) = 20 / 40.
</p>
<p>
Therefore substituting the values into the formula we get:
</p>
<p>
<center>
P( Red FC win | home ) = ( 12 / 15 * 15 / 40 )  / ( 20 / 40 ) = 1 / 2.
</center>
</p>

<p>
The probability of Red FC wining has been updated with the additional information of 
home and away performance from 37.5 % to 60% (betting odds are improving!).  The result from the 
match between Red FC play Blue United can be used to update the table and the probabilities can 
be re-calculated ready for the next game's prediction. 
</p>

<p>
The formula used above describes how a Hypothesis, in this case Red FC winning, 
is updated with additional information, the Evidence, they are playing at home. The formula used above   
can be generalised to: 
<center>
P( H | E ) = P( H | E) * P( H )/P( E ),
</center>
<p>
which is the usual description of Bayes Theorem found on the web.
</p>
</p>

<p>
Bayes Theorem is a way to update our understanding of a situation with new evidence. 
The theorem is at the heart of technologies such as Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, 
health diagnostics, preventing terrorist attacks and searching for boats lost at sea. With 
increasing amounts of data available about how we live, the  application of this technology 
continues to grow and will continue to influence the way that we live.
