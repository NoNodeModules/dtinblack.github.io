description: What can be learned from the magazine Look and Learn.

I use the web at least once an hour to search for information, usually trying to work out the meaning 
of a technical word. With the powerful search engines available and sources of material such as 
Wikipedia most of my questions are answered quickly. This combination is much quicker than the 
traditional way of flicking through a shelf full of dictionaries, encyclopedias and other technical books. 
However, recently I was wondering what was available to bring the information to me; to make me aware, 
open my eyes to new subjects and insights. There is a wide range of material available covering any 
subject that can be imagined but they are aimed at their own specialist readers. In particular the 
various bloggers that I follow which usually stick to their main areas of interest and very 
rarely look sideways.  Then I remembered the children’s magazine 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Look_and_Learn" target="_blank">Look and Learn</a>.

<a href="http://www.lookandlearn.com/history/index.php" target="_blank">Look and Learn</a>
was a British weekly educational magazine for children published from 1962 until 1982.  
It contained educational articles that covered wide and varied subjects from:  the evolution of 
mammoths to the life of a may-fly, development of horse carriages to sources of raw materials 
that make a motor car, and so on. The publication also adapted famous works of literature into 
comic strip and serialized works of fiction such as The First Men in the Moon. It was not frightened 
to add in poetry or art. Look and Learn’s aim was to inspire the imagination of its readers about 
the world that we live in. To support this aim the articles were sharply written and the style could 
vary from a newspaper report to a mysterious detective. Photographs and drawings were carefully 
included to add more information to the article and give the magazine an overall feeling of adventure.

Of course there are many multi-media sources available today for example the BBC produce some of best 
science, social and art documentaries that can be seen which broaden the mind. 
But there is no where available where you can move from say an explanation of different cells 
that make up a human on one page, then on the next read about the structure and symbolism of 
Stravinsky’s Rights of Spring.

So what are the lessons we can take form Look and Learn? First, the editorial approach of combining 
interesting articles in a way that catches the interests of the reader; not knowing what was coming 
next made page turning an adventure. Second, the writing has to be crisp and sharp, which draws in the 
reader in a way, that sparks their imagination enough to a go off and find out more about a subject. 
Finally, get a balance between the images and text such that they complement each other rather than distract.

In the world of multi and social media maybe some of formats from the past for communicating ideas  
are still applicable today, we just need to Look and Learn.
