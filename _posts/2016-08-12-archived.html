title: Applying Little's Law to A&E
description: Application of Little’s Law to complexity of queuing in A&E.

<p>
Sitting in my local Accident and Emergency ( A&E )<sup>1</sup>  waiting for attention I started to watch 
how the staff were managing the wide range of medical problems - I was impressed! There were: 
people holding limbs in great pain, a head covered in sticking plasters, two to three people bright red and 
coughing, a queue of wheel chairs and with a leg in plaster, and somebody hobbling around too sore to sit down.  
Meanwhile in the background Ambulances were rushing in and trollies were quickly wheeled through for immediate attention.
All of this activity is, 
in a management sense, ‘unplanned’ e.g. people could arrive at A&E anytime of the day or night 
with a wide range of problems.  To distract me from my pain I started to think how a typical A&E is 
organised and operates to manage the situation meet the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-hour_target_in_emergency_departments" target="_blank">4 hour waiting target
</a>
</p>

<p>
A few days later 
I started to search for a framework to guide my analysis of an A&E Department. 
Flicking through a few books and searching on the web I came across
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little%27s_law" target="_blank">Little's Law</a>   
which describes the relationship between average queuing length, average arrival 
rate and average waiting time in a queue. More formally, Little's Law is: “The long-term average number of customers in a stable system L is equal to the long-term average 
effective arrival rate, λ, multiplied by the time a customer spends in the system, W; or expressed algebraically: 
L = λW.” The law has many applications from 
<a href="http://web.mit.edu/sgraves/www/papers/Little's%20Law-Published.pdf" target="_blank">storing wine</a>, 
to designing the underlying technology of the Internet. As a first pass at analysing A&E it looked like 
Little's Law could help.  
</p>

<p>
To cut through the mathematical formala symbols I started to play with some numbers and  
using some  
<a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/ae-waiting-times-and-activity/statistical-work-areasae-waiting-times-and-activityae-attendances-and-emergency-admissions-2015-16-monthly-3/" target="_blank">data published monthly</a> on
A&E performance I computed the following:
</p>

<p>
<div class="orderedlist">
<ol>
  <li>Average number of people attending A&E per hour ( λ ) is approximately 12 / hour 
  ( on average there are 8,500 people attending A&E for each hospital in NHS England per month ).</li>
  <li>Assume that a typical A&E department can manage a maximum of 15 cases per hour ( L ).
   </li>
</ol>
</div>
</p>

<p>
Rearranging Little’s Law to give the average waiting time W = L / λ  gives approximately 1.5 hours.  
Also, the formula confirms what we would expect: 
if the A&E department's capcity was increased ( W ) then the waiting time reduce. 
Similarly if the average number of people attending ( λ ) reduces then the waiting time reduces.
</p>

<p>
Of course Little’s Theorem is too simplistic to be applied to the operation of an A&E Department. However,
when trying to answer the question: Why can it not be applied ? - the answers produce some of the factors that are 
adding to the complexity of its operation.  

<p>
Starting with the average arrival rate ( λ ),
<a href="http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN06964/SN06964.pdf" target="_blank">A&E statistics</a> show that there is 
a wide variability and the assumption used above is invalid. For example Monday is the busiest day at A&E with 
attendance 13% above the daily average and also 13% above the next- busiest day, Sunday. 11am 
on Monday is the single busiest hour. 9.5% of attendances are between the hours of midnight and 
7am, while 58% occur between 9am and 6pm. Also, in 2013/14, 24% of A&E attendances arrived by 
ambulance or helicopter who require immediate attention. All of this starts to show
the variability in the arrival rate of people requiring medical attention. 
</p>

<p>
Similarily the wide range of patient's medical problems will affect an A&E department's capacity 
to manage their diagnosis and subsequent treatment. 
For example if there was a major emergency situation, for example a train crash or an 
explosion, then the capacity 
( L ) of the A&E Department would be overloaded. Another area is diagnosing the medical condition.
For example 3% of patients attending A&E have severe life threatening conditions. Also, 
if about 40% of attendees are not seen within an an hour of arrival at A&E their 
condition could deteriorate to life threatening. Also, diagnosising a problem quickly and accurately can be 
difficult for many reasons. In my case 
the A&E staff had to translate my own diagnosis of “I have a pain in my stomach and 
I cann’t pee !” into medical terminology 
of “acute urinary retention” before my condition deteriorated into more severe problems. 
<p>
  
<p>
There are many many more factors that can be discovered by asking why Little's Law can not be applied to 
the operation of A&E Depatment. By teasing out some of the factors that contribute to the complexity of 
its operation then the way that the staff manage the situation is even more impressive !

<p><i>1. Although A&E Departments were renamed to  
<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/jan/12/health.nhs" target="_blank">Emergency Departments</a>
in 2004 it is interesting to note that the public have still use term 'A&E' - is it because it is easier to 
pronounce than ED ?</i></p>
