title:  Job Description For A Mathematician
description: A Career in Mathematics.
---

<p>
You will be joining a highly dynamic profession with a track record of success that stretches over 
4000 years. Mathematicians continue to make major contributions to the development of civilisation, 
and remain at the center of creating solutions that affect many aspects of people's lives.
</p>

<p>
<b>Projects</b>
</p> 

<p>
You will be involved with a wide range of clients at all levels in organisations 
as diverse as education, local and national governments, small to large multinational businesses, policy 
making bodies and charities. Many of the projects require a pioneering approach to solving complex 
problems, very often in diverse environments, and may require the development of new mathematical concepts and 
techniques. Amongst your roles you will be expected to use modeling and simulation techniques to manage and analyse large 
amounts of data. With your mathematical skills and experience you will be expected to help the 
clients understand their problems that will enable them to make better decisions.
</p>

<p>
<b>Role</b>
</p>
<p>
You will be required to shape and drive projects from the initial discussions with the client through to 
successful implementation of the solution. Projects can cover: improving the scheduling of transportation 
to reduce its impact on the environment, linking DNA information to diseases, predicting the spread of 
viruses through populations, developing algorithms used in computer graphics to explore new ways to 
visually represent data and open up new forms of entertainment, optimisation of manufacturing process 
to efficiently produce goods, create new mathematical models for space flight used to explore the universe, 
model human intelligence that will be applied to improve artificial intelligence, and develop new 
learning algorithms to be used in developing new business models for e-commerce.
</p>

<p>Responsibilities:</p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>Develop the objectives of projects, planning the resources and execute the project 
        taking into account risk management, change control and documentation.</li>
    <li>Successfully manage all of the people involved in the project, including the client, 
        scientists, engineers, regulatory and standards groups, senior management and other 
        functions within an organization.</li>
    <li>Communicate the excitement in developing and applying mathematics to  
        audiences ranging from schools to the general public. Also, 
        promote the potential use of mathematics to professions not familiar with 
        its capabilities.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
<b>Your Background</b>
</p>

<p> 
  <ul>
    <li>Must enjoy finding patterns in every day situations whether it is in the geometry of 
        a coastline, the flight path of a tennis ball, or the movement of people through a shopping centre.</li>
    <li>Prepared to sacrifice many hours in answering the question “why?” about the patterns 
        that are observed in the surrounding world, and using the insight derived from the answer, 
        to predict how the patterns will evolve.</li>
    <li>Courage and determination in developing solutions to mathematical problems, and resilient 
        to skepticism about the role of mathematics in everyday life.</li>
  </ul>
