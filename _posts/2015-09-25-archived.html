Dear Noble Prize Committee,
</p>

<p>
For many years I have read the lectures given by the Noble Prize winners. They are a great 
resource for insights into the personalities and their struggles as they break new ground 
in their subjects. The Noble Prize highlights some of the greatest breakthroughs in our 
understanding of the world we live in and although I don’t claim to understand every aspect 
of the lectures I find them inspiring. However, it is a curious fact that there is no Noble 
Prize for mathematics.
</p>

<p>
I understand that when Alfred Noble left most of his fortune in his will for series of prizes 
he stated that they were for those who have shown the "greatest benefit on mankind." However 
he limited the subjects to physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, literature and peace.  
Although I can appreciate that there are many reasons for limiting the number of prizes, 
missing out mathematics is a serious lack of recognition of its impact on the “benefits 
of mankind.” 
</p>

<p>
Therefore I would like to you to consider a Noble Prize for mathematics. Mathematics forces 
a clear understanding of concepts and assumptions involved in a problem. The logical 
requirements ensure that any breakthrough has a sound foundation. Also, it is interesting to note 
that outside of the awards for literature and peace there is invariably some form of mathematics 
supporting the subject that has been awarded a prize. Since the first Noble Prize awarded in 
1901 mathematicians have made significant breakthroughs our understanding for example: John 
Nash, Edward Witten, Alan Turing, Emmy Noether, John von Neumann are just a few who could 
have been considered for a prize in mathematics. Imagine how many more breakthroughs in 
mathematics there would have been with the support of £600,000 prize money and worldwide press 
coverage!
</p>

<p>
Adding another subject to the list of prizes has been done before. The Sveriges Riksbank 
Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, donated by Sweden's central bank to 
celebrate its tercentenary in 1968 has remained on the list. I can appreciate that money 
will be required to support the on going prize for mathematics. However, if you signalled 
that you were open to the idea of adding mathematics to the list of prizes, then maybe Amazon, 
Google, Apple, and Microsoft would be willing to set up an endowment to provide the on-going 
financial award. 
</p>

<p>
I can appreciate that you are busy assessing future recipients for the Noble Prize, but please 
can you find time to consider adding mathematics to the list. Its inclusion to the Noble Prize 
will finally recognize its impact on the “greatest benefits of mankind”.
</p>

<p>
Kind regards,
</p>

<p>
A Mathematician
