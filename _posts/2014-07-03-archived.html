title: Wittgenstein in Books
subtitle: Book recommendations for a gentle introduction to Wittgenstein
---

<p>
There is always a danger when recommending books on a subject. Too difficult and the reader will not get 
past the first few pages. Too easy and they will start wondering why they are bothering.  This fine line 
becomes precarious when recommend books about a philosopher as difficult as Ludwig Wittgenstein. 
</p> 

<p>
Wittgenstein attracts a lot of attention due to his life style: he gave away his fortune that he inherited 
from his millionaire father, decorated in the WWI, was a hospital porter, gardener and teacher, architect 
and at one time thought about being a monk.  This has resulted in in over 2000+ books, a large number of 
web sites, and what feels like a library full of academic papers. Therefore it&#39s very easy to get lost in 
the growing material. However the following books I have found helpful and would recommend as a 
step&#8208by&#8208step introduction to both the man and his work ( the titles of the books are in heavy text 
so that you can cut and paste into your favourite book seller&#39s web site ).
</p> 

<p> 
There are many general books on philosophy that have a section on Wittgenstein, however the most notable is 
Bryan Magee&#39s <b>The Great Philosophers</b> &#8208  the chapter with John Searle ( pg 322 &#8208 347 ) gives a short 
overview of his two works &#8208 <i>Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus</i> ( known as the <i>Tractatus</i> ) and the 
<i>Philosophical Investigations</i>. 
Another book worth a mention is <b>The Great Philosophers</b> by Stephen Law which includes a clear section on 
Wittgenstein&#39s <i>Philosophical Investigations</i> ( pg 156 &#8208 161 ) as well as other philosophers that puts 
his work in context.
</p>

<p> 
A good introduction to the man and his work is Norman Malcolm&#39s <b>Ludwig Wittgenstein A Memoir</b>. 
Malcolm was one Wittgenstein&#39s students and gives a fascinating insight into his character. A more extensive 
book on Wittgensteins life is  Ray Monk&#39s <b>The Duty of Genius</b>. 
</p>

<p> 
Moving more into Wittgenstein&#39s ideas &#8208 A. C. Graylings&#39 book <b>Wittgenstein A Very Short Introduction</b> 
gives a 
flavour of both works. There are many specialised introductions for the <i>Tractatus</i> and <i>Philosophical 
Investigations</i> but Ray Monk&#39s <b>How To Read Wittgenstein</b>, which explains passages from his work, and is a 
fairly short read. Worth a mention is <b>Wittgenstein</b> by P. M. S. Hacker ( part of the The Great Philosophers
 series ) which contains a section on whether a machine, in this case computers, can think.
The book that I first read about the philosopher, was <b>Wittgenstein</b> by Anthony Kenny and remains my favourite 
introduction.
</p>

<p>
A good preparation for reading Wittgenstein&#39s work directly ( he only published the <i>Tractatus</i> in his own 
life time but there are several books of his notes ), for the <i>Tractatus</i> I recommend <b>
Wittgenstein&#39s 
Tractatus an Introduction</b> by H. O Mounce, and for the <i>Philosophical Investigations</i> Marie McGinn&#39s
<b> Wittgenstein and the Philosophical Investigations</b>. 
</p>

<p>
Hopefully the above will help you navigate through the forest of material available about Wittgenstein &#8208 
Good Luck!
