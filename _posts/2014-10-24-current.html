title: To Be A Mathematician?
description: How I learned what it is to be a mathematician.

Holding my breath I knocked on the door. Waited. I knocked again.  
This time a softly spoken ‘yes’ came back; I gripped the door handle and I went in.

The head of the Mathematics Department, the Prof, looked up and carefully put his Parker pen down. 
He was the first real mathematician that I had met. Sitting upright in a room of glass fronted 
bookcases full of mathematics journals and certificates from Cambridge on the wall, I was in awe. 
Sitting in his neatly tailored light tweed jacket with his back to the only window he tidied up his 
papers.  I had never been this close to the Prof he was usually several rows away in a lecture theatre 
and the neatness of his black hair and the strong cheek bones made him look younger than he probably was. 
His intense eyes passed through his dark rimmed glasses and held me under scrutiny.

After completing an Engineering degree and a ‘year out’ to earn some money I had decided that I really 
wanted to study Applied Mathematics. I enjoyed thinking about problems taken from engineering, and then 
developing practical solutions. Therefore I found myself on a two year conversion course at 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranfield_University" target="_blank">Cranfield Institute of Technology </a>
that would develop me to Masters level in Applied Mathematics. But I was now in 
the orbit of real mathematicians and struggling.  
</p>

The Prof was an expert in 

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equation" target="_blank">partial differential 
equations</a>. These equations cover a wide range of applications but his speciality was in working out how

molten steel flowed in castings</a> that are used to shape components used in the 
everyday objects that we use from printers to aeroplanes. 
</p>

<p>
I was good at applying formulae to solve mathematical problems but was hitting a brick wall with his 
homework. I started to take The Prof through my attempts at solving the problems, explaining the different 
formulae that I had tried to apply. Suddenly he sat back in his chair and in a frustrated voice said  
‘Your not an Engineer now, you’re a Mathematician!’.  I felt I was a mathematician after all I was on 
the course.  We started going through the first problem and he pushed me to think harder about the properties 
of the problem: what were the equations telling me ?,  how could they be rearranged ?,  could they be 
simplified ?,  had I solved similar problems ?, could I solve one small part of the problem and build 
my way back to solving the original problem ?  We moved through each problem until I learned that it 
was more important to understand the problem and play with ideas than simply apply formulae.

<p>
Today when I start to think about an engineering problem a sense of excitement begins as I start to 
dig deep into the subject to develop assumptions that allow a playground for ideas and solutions. 
At the back of my mind is the Prof’s words steering me away from the dry shores of applying formulae.
