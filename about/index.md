<p>
I enjoy writing, and when I manage to express a thought clearly in a sentence it gives me a sense of achievement. Better still is when a reader understands what I am trying to say.

Over the years of writing posts I have gathered advice and other resources that I have found helpful in improving my writing - see [writing resources](/assets/md/writing-resources).

This blog uses the <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/analytics/">Google Analytics</a> service to better understand how people are accessing the site. This information is collected in an anonymous form and includes the number of visitors to the site.

The blog is based on the [HPSTR Theme](/assets/md/abouthpstr) and will continue to change as I learn more about page layouts and different approaches to web navigation.

Video embeds are responsive and scale with the width of the main content block with the help of [FitVids](http://fitvidsjs.com/).
